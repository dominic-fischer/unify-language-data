Thus \"white house\" is casa branca, and \"green fields\" is campos verdes; the reverse order (branca casa, verdes campos) is generally limited to poetic language.\nHowever, some adjectives—such as bom (\"good\"), belo (\"nice\"), and grande (\"great\", \"big\")—often precede the noun. Indeed, some of these have rather different meanings depending on position: compare um grande homem \"a great man\", vs. um homem grande \"a big man\".\nAdjectives are routinely inflected for gender and number, according to a few basic patterns, much like those for nouns, as in the following table:\n\n## Adjectives > ### Table 4\n\n<pre>```\n| singular + masc.   | singular + fem.   | plural + masc.   | plural + fem.   | meaning        |\n|:-------------------|:------------------|:-----------------|:----------------|:---------------|\n| branco             | branca            | brancos          | brancas         | \"white\"        |\n| francês            | francesa          | franceses        | francesas       | \"French\"       |\n| motor              | motriz            | motores          | motrizes        | \"motorised\"    |\n| grandão            | grandona          | grandões         | grandonas       | \"rather big\"   |\n| conservador        | conservadora      | conservadores    | conservadoras   | \"conservative\" |\n| europeu            | europeia          | europeus         | europeias       | \"European\"     |\n| verde              | verde             | verdes           | verdes          | \"green\"        |\n| superior           | superior          | superiores       | superiores      | \"superior\"     |\n| feliz              | feliz             | felizes          | felizes         | \"happy\"        |\n| central            | central           | centrais         | centrais        | \"central\"      |\n| civil              | civil             | civis            | civis           | \"futile\"       |\n| fácil              | fácil             | fáceis           | fáceis          | \"easy\"         |\n| azul               | azul              | azuis            | azuis           | \"blue\"         |\n```</pre>\n\n\nA feminine adjective ending in -eia may correspond either to a masculine adjective ending in -eu (e.g. europeu, europeia) or to one ending in -eio (e.g. feio, feia).\nAlthough, some adjectives are invariable, usually the ones whose singular form ending is -s, and a few colour adjectives, generally the compound ones, as in the table below:\n\n## Adjectives > ### Table 5\n\n<pre>```\n| singular + masc.   | singular + fem.   | plural + masc.   | plural + fem.   | meaning       |\n|:-------------------|:------------------|:-----------------|:----------------|:--------------|\n| simples            | simples           | simples          | simples         | \"simple\"      |\n| reles              | reles             | reles            | reles           | \"lousy\"       |\n| azul-claro         | azul-claro        | azul-claro       | azul-claro      | \"light blue\"  |\n| laranja            | laranja           | laranja          | laranja         | \"orange\"      |\n| verde-oliva        | verde-oliva       | verde-oliva      | verde-oliva     | \"olive green\" |\n| ultravioleta       | ultravioleta      | ultravioleta     | ultravioleta    | \"ultraviolet\" |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe adjectives for \"good\" and \"bad\" are irregular:\n\n## Adjectives > ### Table 6\n\n<pre>```\n| singular + masc.   | singular + fem.   | plural + masc.   | plural + fem.   | meaning   |\n|:-------------------|:------------------|:-----------------|:----------------|:----------|\n| bom                | boa               | bons             | boas            | \"good\"    |\n| mau                | má                | maus             | más             | \"bad\"     |\n```</pre>\n\n\nComparison of adjectives is regularly expressed in analytic form using the adverb mais: mais alto (do) que = \"higher than\", o mais alto \"the highest\". Most adjectives have—in addition to their positive, comparative, and superlative forms—a so-called \"absolute superlative\" form (sometimes called \"elative\"), which enhances the meaning of the adjective without explicitly comparing it (lindo, \"beautiful\"; muito lindo or lindíssimo, \"very beautiful\"), it can appear in both analytic or synthetic form.\n\n## Adjectives > ### Table 7\n\n<pre>```\n| Positive         | Comparative                | Superlative                      | Analytic absolute superlative   | Synthetic absolute superlative   |\n|:-----------------|:---------------------------|:---------------------------------|:--------------------------------|:---------------------------------|\n| belo \"pretty\"    | mais belo \"prettier\"       | o mais belo \"the prettiest\"      | muito belo \"very pretty\"        | belíssimo \"very pretty\"          |\n| caro \"expensive\" | mais caro \"more expensive\" | o mais caro \"the most expensive\" | muito caro \"very expensive\"     | caríssimo \"very expensive\"       |\n```</pre>\n\n\nA few adjectives (besides mais itself) have suppletive comparative/superlative forms:\n\n## Adjectives > ### Table 8\n\n<pre>```\n| Positive        | Comparative     | Absolute superlative   | Superlative            |\n|:----------------|:----------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|\n| bom \"good\"      | melhor \"better\" | ótimo \"very good\"      | o melhor \"the best\"    |\n| mau \"bad\"       | pior \"worse\"    | péssimo \"very bad\"     | o pior \"the worst\"     |\n| pequeno \"small\" | menor \"smaller\" | mínimo \"very small\"    | o menor \"the smallest\" |\n| grande \"big\"    | maior \"bigger\"  | máximo \"very big\"      | o maior \"the biggest\"  |\n```</pre>"

        "content": "Portuguese adverbs work much like their English counterparts, e.g. muito (\"very\"), pouco (\"not much\"), longe (\"far\"), muito (\"much, a lot\"), quase (\"almost\"), etc.  To form adverbs from adjectives, the adverbial suffix -mente is generally added to the feminine singular of the adjective, whether or not it differs from the masculine singular. Thus:\n\nclaro (\"clear\", m. sg.) → clara (f. sg.) → claramente (\"clearly\")\nnatural (\"natural\", m. & f. sg.) → naturalmente (\"naturally\")\nUnlike Spanish, an orthographic accent on the adjective is not retained on the adverb; thus for example rápido → rapidamente (\"fast, quickly\").\nAs with adjectives, the comparative of adverbs is almost always formed by placing mais (\"more\") or menos (\"less\") before the adverb.  Thus mais cedo (\"earlier\"), mais rapidamente (\"faster, more quickly\"), etc.\nThe adjectives bom (\"good\") and mau (\"bad\") have irregular adverbial forms: bem (\"well\") and mal (\"badly\"), respectively.  And, like their corresponding adjectival forms,  bem and mal have irregular comparative forms: melhor (\"better\") and pior (\"worse\"), respectively.\nAdverbs of place show a three-way distinction between close to the speaker, close to the listener, and far from both:\n\naqui = \"here\"\ncá = \"here\" (somewhat near me)\naí = \"there\" (near you)\nlá, acolá = \"there\" (far from you, and where I can't see)\nali = \"there\" (somewhat far from both of us, but in my field of view)\nThese adverbs (except by cá and lá) get contracted with de (from).\n\n## Adverbs > ### Table 9\n\n<pre>```\n| preposition   | adverb + Unnamed: 1_level_1   | adverb + Unnamed: 2_level_1   | adverb + Unnamed: 3_level_1   | adverb + Unnamed: 4_level_1   |\n|:--------------|:------------------------------|:------------------------------|:------------------------------|:------------------------------|\n| aqui          | aí                            | ali                           | acolá                         | nan                           |\n| de            | daqui                         | daí                           | dali                          | dacolá                        |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe English concept of phrasal verb—a verb-and-adverb sequence that forms a single semantic unit, such as \"set up\", \"get by\", \"pick out\", etc.—is rare in Portuguese.

These are \"open\" classes, in the sense that they readily accept new members, by coinage, borrowing, or compounding. Interjections form a smaller open class.\nThere are also several small closed classes, such as pronouns, prepositions, articles, demonstratives, numerals, and conjunctions. A few grammatically peculiar words are difficult to categorize; these include cadê (\"where is\"—Braz., colloq.), tomara (\"let's hope\"), oxalá (\"let's hope that\"), and eis (\"here is\"; cf. Latin ecce and French voilà).\nWithin the four main classes there are many semi-regular mechanisms that can be used to derive new words from existing words, sometimes with change of class; for example, veloz (\"fast\") → velocíssimo (\"very fast\"), medir (\"to measure\") → medição (\"measurement\"), piloto (\"pilot\") → pilotar (\"to pilot\"). Finally, there are several phrase embedding mechanisms that allow arbitrarily complex phrases to behave like nouns, adjectives, or adverbs."

It is used in adverbial subordinate clauses, usually introduced by se (\"if\") or quando (\"when\"), or in adjectival subordinate clauses that express a neutral or expected condition for a present- or future-tense main clause:\nse cantarmos, seremos pagos (\"If we (should) sing, we will be paid\")\nse cantarmos, ele fica (\"If we (should) sing, he stays\")\nquando cantarmos, ele escutará (\"When we (should) sing, he will listen\")\nOften, the option between indicative and subjunctive depends on whether the speaker does or does not endorse the proposition expressed by the subordinate clause:\nAdmito que ele roubou a bicicleta. (\"I admit that he stole the bicycle.\")\nAdmito que ele possa ter roubado a bicicleta. (\"I admit that he could have stolen the bicycle.\")\nIn relative clauses, the option between indicative and subjunctive depends on whether the speaker does or does not identify a single object with the property expressed by the relative clause:\nAndo à procura de um cão que fala! (\"I'm looking for a certain dog which can speak!\")\nAndo à procura de um cão que fale! (\"I'm looking for any dog that speaks!\")\nMore on the subjunctive mood in Portuguese can be found at Wikibooks: Variation of the Portuguese Verbs."

        "content": "Following the general Indo-European pattern, the central element of almost any Portuguese clause is a verb, which may directly connect to one, two, or (rarely) three nouns (or noun-like phrases), called the subject, the object (more specifically, the direct object), and the complement (more specifically, the object complement or objective complement). The most frequent order of these elements in Portuguese is subject–verb–object (SVO, as in examples (1) and (2) below), or, when a complement is present, subject–verb–object-complement (SVOC — examples (3) and (4)):\n\n(1) {A Maria}S {ama}V {o Paulo}O, \"Maria loves Paulo.\"\n(2) {O pedreiro}S {construiu}V {a casa}O, \"The mason has constructed the house.\"\n(3) {O presidente}S {nomeou}V o {Pedro}O {ministro}C, \"The president appointed Pedro (as) minister.\"\n(4) {Ela}S {achou}V {o livro}O {uma chatice}C, \"She found the book a bore.\"\nAny of the three noun elements may be omitted if it can be inferred from the context or from other syntactic clues; but many grammatical rules will still apply as if the omitted parts were there.\nA clause will often contain a number of adverbs (or adverbial phrases) that modify the meaning of the verb; they may be inserted between the major components of the clause. Additional nouns can be connected to the verb by means of prepositions; the resulting prepositional phrases have an adverbial function.  For example:\n\nEle carregou {sem demora} a mala {para ela} {do carro} {até a porta}, \"He carried {without delay} the bag {for her} {from the car} {to the door}.\""

        "content": "Portuguese is a null-subject language, meaning that it permits and sometimes mandates the omission of an explicit subject.\nIn Portuguese, the grammatical person of the subject is generally reflected by the inflection of the verb. Sometimes, though an explicit subject is not necessary to form a grammatically correct sentence, one may be stated in order to emphasize its importance. Some sentences, however, do not allow a subject at all and in some other cases an explicit subject would sound awkward or unnatural:\n\n\"I'm going home\" can be translated either as vou para casa or as eu vou para casa, where eu means \"I\".\n\"It's raining\" is está a chover in European Portuguese, or está chovendo in Brazilian Portuguese, neither of which occurs with an explicit subject. Some older speakers say ele está a chover \"it is raining\", where ele \"he/it\" refers to the masculine subject o tempo \"the weather\". Nowadays this usage is uncommon and seen as old-fashioned.\nQue horas são? \"what time is it?\" (literally \"what hours are they?\"). Some older speakers say que horas são ele?, where ele refers to o tempo \"the time\" (o tempo can also mean \"the weather\"). Nowadays this usage is uncommon and seen as old-fashioned.\nIn European Portuguese, only in exceptional circumstances would \"I'm going home; I'm going to watch TV\" be translated as eu vou para casa; eu vou ver televisão. At least the second eu (\"I\") would normally be omitted, if not both. Meanwhile, in Brazilian Portuguese, the subject pronoun is more likely to be repeated.\nAs in other null subject language with a SVO word order, the subject is often postponed, mostly in existential sentences, in answers to partial questions and in contrast structures:\n\nExistem muitos ratos aqui! (\"There are many mice here!\") — Verb existem, subject ratos, complement aqui indicating place.\nQuem é que foi? Fui eu. (\"Who was it? It was me.\") — Verb fui, subject eu.\nEla não comeu o bolo, mas comi-o eu. (European Portuguese) or ...mas eu comi (Brazilian Portuguese) (\"She didn't eat the cake, but I did.\") — Subject ela, negation não, verb comeu, object o bolo; the complement divides itself into: adversative conjunction mas, verb comi, object -o, subject eu."

Portuguese grammarians call subjunctive \"conjuntivo\"; Brazilians call it \"subjuntivo\".\nNote that the synthetic future and conditional have largely disappeared from everyday speech.  The synthetic future is generally replaced by ir + infinitive (e.g. vou cantar \"I will sing\"), while the conditional is replaced either by the imperfect (especially in its modal use; se você me desse dinheiro, eu cantava \"if you gave me money, I would sing\") or by the imperfect of ir + infinitive (in its non-modal, \"future of the past\" usage; ele disse que ia cantar \"he said that he would sing\").  However, the synthetic future subjunctive is still in common use (e.g. se você for \"if you should go\").  The synthetic future and conditional of verbs with one-syllable infinitives also sometimes occur (e.g. será/seria \"it will/would be\" or in the compound tenses terá/teria sido \"it will/would have been\").\nIn regular verbs, the personal infinitive is identical to the subjunctive future tense; but they are different in irregular verbs: quando formos (\"when we go\", subjunctive) versus é melhor irmos (\"it is better that we go\").\nThere are also many compound tenses expressed with inflected forms of the auxiliary verbs ser and estar (variants of \"to be\"), haver and ter (variants of \"to have\")."

It is used in adverbial subordinate clauses, usually introduced by se (\"if\") or quando (\"when\"), or in adjectival subordinate clauses that express a neutral or expected condition for a present- or future-tense main clause:\nse cantarmos, seremos pagos (\"If we (should) sing, we will be paid\")\nse cantarmos, ele fica (\"If we (should) sing, he stays\")\nquando cantarmos, ele escutará (\"When we (should) sing, he will listen\")\nOften, the option between indicative and subjunctive depends on whether the speaker does or does not endorse the proposition expressed by the subordinate clause:\nAdmito que ele roubou a bicicleta. (\"I admit that he stole the bicycle.\")\nAdmito que ele possa ter roubado a bicicleta. (\"I admit that he could have stolen the bicycle.\")\nIn relative clauses, the option between indicative and subjunctive depends on whether the speaker does or does not identify a single object with the property expressed by the relative clause:\nAndo à procura de um cão que fala! (\"I'm looking for a certain dog which can speak!\")\nAndo à procura de um cão que fale! (\"I'm looking for any dog that speaks!\")\nMore on the subjunctive mood in Portuguese can be found at Wikibooks: Variation of the Portuguese Verbs."

        "content": "Grammatical gender of inanimate entities is sometimes different from that used in sister languages: thus, for example, Portuguese árvore (\"tree\") and flor (\"flower\") are feminine, while Spanish árbol and Italian fiore are masculine; Portuguese mar (\"sea\") and mapa (\"map\") are masculine, while French mer and carte are feminine.\nIn many cases, the gender and number of a noun can be deduced from its ending: the basic pattern is \"-o\" / \"-os\" for masculine singular and plural, \"-a\" / \"-as\" for feminine singular and plural. So, casa (\"house\"), mala (\"suitcase\"), pedra (\"stone\"), and inteligência (\"intelligence\") are feminine, while carro (\"car\"), saco (\"bag\"), tijolo (\"brick\"), and aborrecimento (\"annoyance\") are masculine. However, the complete rules are quite complex: for instance, nouns ending in -ção are usually feminine, except for augmentatives like bração (\"big arm\"). And there are many irregular exceptions. For words ending in other letters, there are few rules: flor (\"flower\"), gente (\"folk\"), nau (\"ship\"), maré (\"tide\") are feminine, while amor (\"love\"), pente (\"comb\"), pau (\"stick\"), café (\"coffee\") are masculine.\nOn the other hand, the gender of some nouns, as well as of first- and second-person pronouns, is determined semantically by the sex or gender of the referent: esta estudante é nova, mas aquele estudante é velho (\"this (female) student is new, but that (male) student is old\";\nor eu sou brasileiro (\"I am Brazilian\", said by a man) and eu sou brasileira (the same, said by a woman). Honorific forms of address such as Vossa Excelência (\"Your Excellency\") exhibit noun/adjective agreement internally, but require agreement according to the gender of the referent for other modifiers, as in Vossa Excelência está atarefado (\"Your Excellency is busy\").\nAlso, many animate masculine nouns have specific feminine derivative forms to indicate female sex or social gender: lobo (\"wolf\" or \"male wolf\", masculine gender) → loba (\"she-wolf\", feminine), conde (\"count\", m.) → condessa (\"countess\", f.), doutor (\"doctor\" or \"male doctor\", m.) → doutora (\"female doctor\", f.), ator (\"actor\", m.) → atriz (\"actress\", f.), etc. The feminine noun derivations should not be confused with the adjectival gender inflections, which use different (and more regular) rules."

If the singular ends in s, then if the last syllable is stressed, the plural adds -es, and otherwise the plural is the same as the singular. Words ending in m change that m into ns, and words ending in l change that l  into -is (e.g. animal > animais). Before 1943, the plural of words that ended in l, was -es, so: Crystal -> Crystaes, Papel -> Papees. Words ending in ão vary in how they form their plurals: some replace  the ão with ães, others with ões, and others just add an -s like the other nouns ending in a vowel."

        "content": "Grammatical gender of inanimate entities is sometimes different from that used in sister languages: thus, for example, Portuguese árvore (\"tree\") and flor (\"flower\") are feminine, while Spanish árbol and Italian fiore are masculine; Portuguese mar (\"sea\") and mapa (\"map\") are masculine, while French mer and carte are feminine.\nIn many cases, the gender and number of a noun can be deduced from its ending: the basic pattern is \"-o\" / \"-os\" for masculine singular and plural, \"-a\" / \"-as\" for feminine singular and plural. So, casa (\"house\"), mala (\"suitcase\"), pedra (\"stone\"), and inteligência (\"intelligence\") are feminine, while carro (\"car\"), saco (\"bag\"), tijolo (\"brick\"), and aborrecimento (\"annoyance\") are masculine. However, the complete rules are quite complex: for instance, nouns ending in -ção are usually feminine, except for augmentatives like bração (\"big arm\"). And there are many irregular exceptions. For words ending in other letters, there are few rules: flor (\"flower\"), gente (\"folk\"), nau (\"ship\"), maré (\"tide\") are feminine, while amor (\"love\"), pente (\"comb\"), pau (\"stick\"), café (\"coffee\") are masculine.\nOn the other hand, the gender of some nouns, as well as of first- and second-person pronouns, is determined semantically by the sex or gender of the referent: esta estudante é nova, mas aquele estudante é velho (\"this (female) student is new, but that (male) student is old\";\nor eu sou brasileiro (\"I am Brazilian\", said by a man) and eu sou brasileira (the same, said by a woman). Honorific forms of address such as Vossa Excelência (\"Your Excellency\") exhibit noun/adjective agreement internally, but require agreement according to the gender of the referent for other modifiers, as in Vossa Excelência está atarefado (\"Your Excellency is busy\").\nAlso, many animate masculine nouns have specific feminine derivative forms to indicate female sex or social gender: lobo (\"wolf\" or \"male wolf\", masculine gender) → loba (\"she-wolf\", feminine), conde (\"count\", m.) → condessa (\"countess\", f.), doutor (\"doctor\" or \"male doctor\", m.) → doutora (\"female doctor\", f.), ator (\"actor\", m.) → atriz (\"actress\", f.), etc. The feminine noun derivations should not be confused with the adjectival gender inflections, which use different (and more regular) rules."

On the other hand, most uses of diminutives are avoided in written and otherwise formal language.\nThe most common diminutive endings are -inho and -inha, replacing -o and -a, respectively. Words with the stress on the last syllable generally have -zinho or -zinha added, such as café \"coffee\" and cafezinho \"coffee served as a show of hospitality\".

Even the numeral um (one) can informally become unzinho.\nThe most common augmentatives are the masculine -ão and the feminine -ona, although there are others, like -aço(a) e.g. mulher/mulheraça (\"woman\"); or -eirão, e.g. voz/vozeirão (\"voice\"), less frequently used. Sometimes the masculine augmentative can be applied to a feminine noun, which then becomes grammatically masculine, but with a feminine meaning, e.g. a mulher / o mulherão (\"the woman\" / \"the big woman\")."

(\"next Friday!\").\nThe demonstratives, like the articles, form contractions with certain preceding prepositions: de + este = deste (\"of this\"), de + esse = desse (\"of that\"), em + aquilo = naquilo (\"in that thing\"), a + aquela = àquela (\"to that\").\n\n## Personal pronouns and possessives > ### Demonstratives > #### Table 15\n\n<pre>```\n| preposition   | demonstrative pronoun + Unnamed: 1_level_1   | demonstrative pronoun + Unnamed: 2_level_1   | demonstrative pronoun + Unnamed: 3_level_1   | demonstrative pronoun + Unnamed: 4_level_1   | demonstrative pronoun + Unnamed: 5_level_1   | demonstrative pronoun + Unnamed: 6_level_1   | demonstrative pronoun + Unnamed: 7_level_1   | demonstrative pronoun + Unnamed: 8_level_1   | demonstrative pronoun + Unnamed: 9_level_1   | demonstrative pronoun + Unnamed: 10_level_1   | demonstrative pronoun + Unnamed: 11_level_1   | demonstrative pronoun + Unnamed: 12_level_1   | demonstrative pronoun + Unnamed: 13_level_1   | demonstrative pronoun + Unnamed: 14_level_1   | demonstrative pronoun + Unnamed: 15_level_1   |\n|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|\n| este          | esta                                         | estes                                        | estas                                        | isto                                         | esse                                         | essa                                         | esses                                        | essas                                        | isso                                         | aquele                                        | aquela                                        | aqueles                                       | aquelas                                       | aquilo                                        | nan                                           |\n| de            | deste                                        | desta                                        | destes                                       | destas                                       | disto                                        | desse                                        | dessa                                        | desses                                       | dessas                                       | disso                                         | daquele                                       | daquela                                       | daqueles                                      | daquelas                                      | daquilo                                       |\n| em            | neste                                        | nesta                                        | nestes                                       | nestas                                       | nisto                                        | nesse                                        | nessa                                        | nesses                                       | nessas                                       | nisso                                         | naquele                                       | naquela                                       | naqueles                                      | naquelas                                      | naquilo                                       |\n| a             | -                                            | -                                            | -                                            | -                                            | -                                            | -                                            | -                                            | -                                            | -                                            | -                                             | àquele                                        | àquela                                        | àqueles                                       | àquelas                                       | àquilo                                        |\n```</pre>\n\n\nDemonstrative adjectives are identical to demonstrative pronouns: e.g. aquele carro \"that car\", and aquele \"that one.\""

As a consequence, a regular Portuguese verb stem can take over 50 distinct suffixes. (For comparison, regular verbs have about 40 distinct forms in Italian and about 30 in modern French.)"

        "content": "The infinitive is used, as in English, as a nominal expression of an action or state at an unspecified time, and possibly with an indefinite or implicit subject, e.g. queremos cantar (\"we would like to sing\"), cantar é agradável (lit. \"to sing is pleasant\"). Many of its uses would be translated into English by the \"-ing\" nominal form, e.g. mesa para cortar (\"cutting table\"), cantar é bom (\"singing is good\"), trabalhe sem parar (\"work without pausing\").\nEuropean Portuguese has the distinct feature of preferentially using the infinitive preceded by the preposition \"a\" in place of the gerund as the typical method of describing continuing action:\n\nEstou lendo.\n\"I am reading.\" (Brazilian Portuguese)\nEstou a ler.\n\"I am reading.\" (European Portuguese)\nEstavam dormindo.\n\"They were sleeping.\" (Brazilian Portuguese)\nEstavam a dormir.\n\"They were sleeping.\" (European Portuguese)\nThe gerund \"-ndo\" form is still correct in European Portuguese and it is used colloquially in the Alentejo region, but relatively rare (although its adverbial uses and the other participle forms are not uncommon). On the other hand, the \"a + infinitive\" form is virtually nonexistent in Brazil, and is considered incorrect in Brazilian Portuguese, though it can be found in 19th-century literature.\nA distinctive trait of Portuguese grammar (shared with the Galician and Sardinian languages) is the existence of infinitive verb forms inflected according to the person and number of the subject:\n\nÉ melhor voltar, \"It is better to go back\" (impersonal) or \"It is better [that] I go back\"\nÉ melhor voltares, \"It is better that you go back\"\nÉ melhor voltarmos, \"It is better that we go back\"\nDepending on the context and intended sense, the personal infinitive may be forbidden, required, or optional.\nPersonal infinitive sentences may often be used interchangeably with finite subordinate clauses. In these cases, finite clauses are usually associated with the more formal registers of the language."

It is never inflected for person or number.\nIn European Portuguese, the gerund is often replaced by the infinitive (preceded by \"a\") when used to express continuing action.\nThe participle of regular verbs is used in compound verb tenses, as in ele havia cantado (\"he had sung\"). It can also be used as an adjective, and in this case it is inflected to agree with the noun's gender and number: um hino cantado (\"a sung anthem\", masculine singular), três árias cantadas (\"three sung arias\", feminine plural). Some verbs have two distinct forms (one regular, one irregular) for these two uses. Additionally, a few verbs have two different verbal participles, a regular one for the active voice, and an irregular one for the passive voice. An example is the verb matar (to kill): Bruto havia matado César (\"Brutus had killed Cesar\"), César foi morto por Bruto (\"Cesar was killed by Brutus\"). Regular participle forms always end with -ado, for first conjugation verbs, or with -ido, for second and third conjugation verbs."

Portuguese grammarians call subjunctive \"conjuntivo\"; Brazilians call it \"subjuntivo\".\nNote that the synthetic future and conditional have largely disappeared from everyday speech.  The synthetic future is generally replaced by ir + infinitive (e.g. vou cantar \"I will sing\"), while the conditional is replaced either by the imperfect (especially in its modal use; se você me desse dinheiro, eu cantava \"if you gave me money, I would sing\") or by the imperfect of ir + infinitive (in its non-modal, \"future of the past\" usage; ele disse que ia cantar \"he said that he would sing\").  However, the synthetic future subjunctive is still in common use (e.g. se você for \"if you should go\").  The synthetic future and conditional of verbs with one-syllable infinitives also sometimes occur (e.g. será/seria \"it will/would be\" or in the compound tenses terá/teria sido \"it will/would have been\").\nIn regular verbs, the personal infinitive is identical to the subjunctive future tense; but they are different in irregular verbs: quando formos (\"when we go\", subjunctive) versus é melhor irmos (\"it is better that we go\").\nThere are also many compound tenses expressed with inflected forms of the auxiliary verbs ser and estar (variants of \"to be\"), haver and ter (variants of \"to have\")."

Most of them were directly derived from the accusatives of the present participles of Latin verbs, a form which was not retained by Portuguese. Thus, for example, Portuguese mutante (\"changing\", \"varying\") does not derive from the Portuguese verb mudar (\"to change\"), but directly from the Latin accusative present participle mutantem (\"changing\"). On the other hand, those pairs of words were eventually generalized by Portuguese speakers into a derivational rule, that is somewhat irregular and defective but still productive. So, for example, within the last 500 years we had the derivation pï'poka (Tupi for \"to pop the skin\") → pipoca (Portuguese for \"popcorn\") → pipocar (\"to pop up all over\") → pipocante (\"popping up all over\").\nSimilar processes resulted in many other semi-regular derivational rules that turn verbs into words of other classes, as in the following examples:\n\nclicar (\"to click\") → clicável (\"clickable\")\nvender (\"to sell\") → vendedor (\"seller\")\nencantar (\"to enchant\") → encantamento (\"enchantment\")\ndestilar (\"to distill\") → destilação (\"distillation\")\nThe latter rule is quite productive, to the point that the pervasive -ção ending (derived from Latin -tione) is a visually striking feature of written Portuguese."
