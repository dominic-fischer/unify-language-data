        "content": "The term \"adjective\", as applied to Swahili and most other Bantu languages, usually applies only to a rather restricted set of words. However, in the wider sense, it can refer to any word that modifies a noun. The wider sense is used here. Adjectives in the stricter Bantu sense are referred to as \"true adjectives\" in this article. True adjectives in Swahili may be divided into two categories: inflecting adjectives, which take a prefix indicating the noun class of their referent, and invariable adjectives, which do not take a prefix.\nAll adjectives follow the noun they modify; aside from the plain adjectives, they also require some kind of prefix whose class matches the preceding noun. The different types of adjectives reflect the different prefixes that are used:\n\nInflecting adjectives are true adjectives which are prefixed with an adjective concord.\nPlain adjectives are true adjectives which do not take concord prefixes.\nRelatives are relativised verbs which can be used as adjectives.\nGenitives are phrases consisting of a noun introduced by the genitive preposition -a.\nOrnatives are phrases consisting of a noun introduced by the ornative preposition -enye."

        "content": "Inflecting adjectives are words which describe a noun or pronoun and take the following prefixes, which are very similar to the prefixes found on nouns. This distinguishes them from determiners, which take prefixes similar to those on verbs. The most notable departure from the nominal inflection pattern among inflecting adjectives is the replacement of the nominal u- prefix in class 11 (and generally also 14) with the adjectival m- prefix. The locative classes also carry prefixes, unlike the locative nouns they refer to.\nMost inflecting adjectives have stems beginning with a consonant. Of those that begin with a vowel, almost all of these have stems that begin with either e (for example, -ekundu \"red\") or i (e.g. -ingi \"many, much\"). A very small minority of adjectives begin with other vowels, but these happen to refer only to animate referents and thus only have forms in classes 1 and 2, for example: -ovu \"evil, wicked\", which is mwovu in class 1 and waovu in class 2.\n\n## Adjectives > ### Inflecting Adjectives > #### Table 19\n\n<pre>```\n|   Unnamed: 0_level_0 + Class | Nominally prefixed + Before Consonant   | Nominally prefixed + Replacing i   | Nominally prefixed + Replacing e   |\n|-----------------------------:|:----------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|\n|                            1 | m-                                      | mwi-                               | mwe-                               |\n|                            2 | wa-                                     | we-                                | we-                                |\n|                            3 | m-                                      | mwi-                               | mwe-                               |\n|                            4 | mi-                                     | mi-                                | mye-                               |\n|                            5 | (ji-)[a]                                | ji-                                | je-                                |\n|                            6 | ma-                                     | me-                                | me-                                |\n|                            7 | ki-                                     | ki-                                | che-                               |\n|                            8 | vi-                                     | vi-                                | vye-                               |\n|                            9 | N-[b]                                   | nyi-                               | nye-[c]                            |\n|                           10 | N-[b]                                   | nyi-                               | nye-[c]                            |\n|                           11 | m-                                      | mwi-                               | mwe-                               |\n|                           14 | m-/u-[d]                                | mwi-/wi-[d]                        | mwe-/we-[d]                        |\n|                           15 | ku-                                     | kwi-                               | kwe-                               |\n|                           16 | pa-                                     | pe-                                | pe-                                |\n|                           17 | ku-                                     | kwi-                               | kwe-                               |\n|                           18 | mu-                                     | mwi-                               | mwe-                               |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe adjective -ingine \"other\", is sometimes given inflections prefixes of the type found with determiners, following a verbal rather than a nominal pattern. Most notably, the forms lingine in class 5, ingine or yingine in class 9 and zingine in class 10 may be heard. Some speakers also use an e in these classes: jengine, lengine, nyengine, yengine and zengine sometimes occurring. These forms are regarded as non-standard, although they may be commonly heard. The standard forms of each are jingine for class 5 and nyingine for classes 9 and 10.\nThe numerals -moja \"one\", -wili \"two\", -tatu \"three\", -nne \"four\", -tano \"five\" and -nane \"eight\", as well as all numbers that end with these words, take prefixes as inflecting adjectives do. \n\nmtu mmoja \"one person\", watu wawili \"two people\", watu ishirini na mmoja \"twenty-one people\", watu ishirini na wawili \"twenty-two people\"\nkitabu kimoja \"one book\", vitabu viwili \"two books\", vitabu ishirini na kimoja \"twenty-one books\", vitabu ishirini na viwili \"twenty-two books\"\nnyumba moja \"one house\", nyumba mbili \"two houses\", nyumba ishirini na moja \"twenty-one houses\", nyumba ishirini na mbili \"twenty-two houses\""

For example, there is no true adjectives equivalent to the English adjective \"open\". The verb kufunguliwa \"to be opened\", when relativised, conveys this meanings. Examples of this in use:\n\nmlango uliofunguliwa \"open door\" (door which was opened)\nmilango iliyofunguliwa \"open doors\" (doors which were opened)\ndirisha lililofunguliwa \"open window\" (window which was opened)\nmadirisha yaliyofunguliwa \"open windows\" (windows which were opened)\nSimilarly, although the adjective -fu \"dead\", \"deceased\" exists, it is comparatively infrequently used, its meaning often instead being expressed through a relativisation of the verb kufa \"to die\". Examples.\n\nndege aliyekufa \"dead bird\" (bird which died, c.f. ndege mfu)\nndege waliokufa \"dead birds\" (birds which died, c.f. ndege wafu)\nRelativised verbs are frequently used in phrases describing time:\n\nwiki iliyopita \"last week\" (week which passed)\nwiki mbili zilizopita \"two weeks ago (two weeks which passed)\nwiki ijayo \"next week\" (week which comes, coming week)\nwiki tatu zijazo \"in three weeks\" (three weeks which come, three coming weeks)\nmwaka uliopita \"last year\" (year which passed)\nmiaka minne iliyopita \"four years ago\" (four years which passed)\nmwaka ujao \"next year\" (year which comes, coming year)\nmiaka miwili ijayo \"in two years\" (two years which come, two coming years)"

pattern. The genitive pronominal forms -angu, -ako, -ake, -etu, -enu and -ao are frequently inflected with a group of nouns referring to close human relationships with their appropriate class 9/10 concords, regardless of the fact that they are animate (giving yangu, yako, yetu etc. in singular and zangu, zako, zetu etc. in plural). For some speakers, the same rule applies to the simple genitive preposition -a (giving ya in singular and za in plural), however for most speakers wa is used for all animate nouns regardless of number or class. Other parts of speech are unaffected by this exception.\n\n## Nouns > ### Concord > #### Table 9: Class 9/10 Animate:\n\n<pre>```\n| 0

        "similarity": 1.0,
        "content": "Both the subject and, when applicable, the object of the verb are indicated by prefixes or concords attached to the verb stem. Swahili is a pro-drop language: explicit personal pronouns are only used for emphasis, or with verb forms that do not indicate subject or object. When a noun is used as the subject or object, then the concord must match its class. Animate nouns (referring to a person or animal) are an exception and these occur with concords of the noun classes 1 (singular) or 2 (plural). The subject concord must always be present, except in the infinitive, habitual and imperative forms. The object concord is generally optional; although some sources maintain that it must always be used with animate objects, this appears not to be the case as counter-examples are commonplace. Whether it is used or not appears to have to do with animacy, specificity and definiteness as well as pragmatic considerations of emphasis.\nSix different forms of verbal concord exist.\nFor the subject, there are both negative and positive forms, while there are only positive forms for objects. The negative subject concords are formed by prefixing the syllable ha- to the beginning, except for the irregular forms si- (instead of *hani-), hu- (instead of *hau-) and ha- (instead of *haa-) which are used, respectively, for first, second and third person singular animate subjects.\nAdditionally, in (the third person singular of) noun class 1, the prefix yu- is used instead of a- as the subject of a locative copula. (This yu- can also be seen in the demonstratives.) The negative form of yu- is formed regularly, by appending the prefix ha-.\nBefore the present 'indefinite' marker -a-, subject concords are shortened to just a consonant or consonant cluster in a similar manner to the prefix which occur on the genitive preposition -a.\nObject concords are generally the same as the positive subject concord, although there are a few exceptions for instances involving animate referents; 2nd person singular and plural, as well as 3rd person singular (class 1) all have different forms for subject and object concord.\n\n## Verbs > ### Subject and object

him/her.\" (with emphasis)\nNinampa zawadi. \"I give him/her a gift.\"\nBecause the 2nd person plural object prefix -wa- is the same as the object prefix for class 2 (3rd person plural object), a word such as ninawaona may ambiguously mean \"I see you all\" or \"I see them.\" These two possibilities may be disambiguated by placing the pronoun after the verb: ninawaona ninyi / wao. Very frequently, however, the suffix -eni is appended to the verb to indicate that the second person plural is meant: ninawaoneni \"I see you all.\"  This suffix causes the final a of Bantu verbs to shift to e. On loan verbs, this suffix is simply -ni. Some speakers use the prefix -ku- (otherwise indicating 2nd person singular) with the suffix -(e)ni, as in ninakuoneni \"I see you all.\"\nThe reflexive prefix only occurs as an object, and refers back to the subject of the sentence. It is equivalent to English forms like myself, yourself, himself and so on.\n\nninajitetea \"I defend myself\"\nanajiona \"he sees himself\" (idiomatically, may mean: \"he is conceited\")"

All together, Tense, Aspect and Mood may be abbreviated as TAM.\nThe following table shows a summary of TAM forms which will be discussed in further depth below. Brackets indicate optional elements and slashes indicate alternative elements of which either (but not both) may fill the same slot in the verb. The column labelled 'final vowel' is only relevant for \"short\" and \"common verbs\", with \"loan verbs\" remaining invariable here with the exception of the -ni suffix added to indicate 2nd person plural address. In any TAM form, when the object is 2nd person plural, this -(e)ni prefix may also occur, but this is not shown in this table.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Table 24: Summary of

The presence of an object prefix (including the reflexive ji-) causes the final -a of Bantu verbs to become -e. Note that the ji- prefix of reflexive verbs is an object prefix, meaning, for example, that the imperative of -jifunza \"to learn\" is jifunze \"learn!\" and not *jifunza.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Imperative > ##### Table 25: Formation of the imperative\n\n<pre>```\n| Unnamed: 0   | Common verbs   | Short verbs   | Loan verb   |\n|:-------------|:---------------|:--------------|:------------|\n| Singular     | ___a           | ku___a        | ___         |\n| Singular     | [OBJ]___e      | [OBJ]___e     | [OBJ]___    |\n| Plural       | ___eni         | ku___eni      | ___ni       |\n| Plural       | [OBJ]___eni    | [OBJ]___eni   | [OBJ]___ni  |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe plural form, with the suffix -ni, is used when addressing multiple people.\nThe following verbs have irregular imperatives, regular forms may be heard, particularly by non-native speakers and particularly in Kenya, and regular forms may be interpreted as less polite:\n\nkuja \"to come\": njoo (pl. njooni)\nkwenda \"to go\" : nenda (pl. nendeni)\nkuleta \"to bring\": lete (pl. leteni)\nThe verb -acha may informally be given the imperative form wacha (pl. wacheni).\nAdditionally, the verb kuwa \"to be\" has an irregular imperative form: iwe (pl. iweni), although this is rarely used and more frequently replaced by a regular imperative form kuwa (pl. kuweni) or used in the subjunctive (\"polite imperative\") form: uwe (pl. mwe).\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Imperative > ##### Table 26: Examples (singular then plural)\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb     | Alone                       | With object                             |\n|:---------|:----------------------------|:----------------------------------------|\n| -nywa    | Kunywa!

The equivalent is achieved with the negative subjunctive (as in Spanish). The formation of this is outlined below, but for the sake of completeness the negative equivalents of the above examples are given here.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Imperative > ##### Table 27: Examples (singular then plural)\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb     | Alone                                 | With object                                       |\n|:---------|:--------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|\n| -nywa    | Usinywe!

Msijifunze! \"Don't learn!\"            |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe suffix -ni is used when the order is addressed to each of the people. When an order is given to any of the addressed persons the subjunctive mood is used.\nFor instance when a load is meant to be carried, if it is heavy and all the people should help, Bebeni mzigo. When anyone could help carrying on their own Mbebe mzigo. When introducing people in a waiting room, Mkae hapa implies that all the people will be called together. Kaeni hapa implies that anyone could sit and they will be called one by one. The suffix -ni is thus the locative suffix which specifies that the order is given to everyone, distinctly in the time-space."

In modern, standard Swahili, however, there is no great difference in meaning between these two forms as the \"indefinite present\" is more or less obsolete and rarely used other than its frequent appearance in media headlines.

The distinction between the \"definite\" and \"indefinite\" present tense forms appears to vanish in the first person as both begin with a na-, however short verbs retain their -ku- extension in the -na- tense and lose it in the -a- tense, allowing this distinction to still be felt, such as in (ni)nakula \"I eat\", in the -na- present tense, versus nala \"I eat\", in the -a- present tense.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Present tenses > ##### Table 29: Examples (\"definite\", \"indefinite\", negative)\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb    | Example                                                | Notes                                                              |\n|:--------|:-------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| -enda   | Anakwenda. \"She goes\" / \"She's going.\"                 | (Anaenda is also used.)                                            |\n| -enda   | Aenda. \"She goes.\"                                     | nan                                                                |\n| -enda   | Haendi. \"She doesn't go.\" / \"She isn't going.\"         | nan                                                                |\n| -la     | (Ni)nakula. \"I eat.\" / \"I am eating.\"                  | Short verb: -ku- prevents -na- from being stressed                 |\n| -la     | Nala. \"I eat.\"                                         | Short verb: -a- has no problem taking stress.                      |\n| -la     | Sili. \"I'm not eating.\" / \"I don't eat.\"               | Short verb: si-, like all subject/object prefixes, can take stress |\n| -andika | Unaandika. \"You write.\" / \"You are writing.\"           | nan                                                                |\n| -andika | Waandika. \"You write.\"                                 | May also mean \"They write.\" U- + a- = wa-; wa- + -a- = wa-         |\n| -andika | Huandiki. \"You don't write.\" / \"You aren't writing.\"   | nan                                                                |\n| -jibu   | Tunajibu. \"We answer\" / \"We are answering.\"            | nan                                                                |\n| -jibu   | Twajibu. \"We answer.\"                                  | nan                                                                |\n| -jibu   | Hatujibu. \"We don't answer.\" / \"We are not answering.\" | Loan verb, no -a suffix to be changed to -i.                       |\n```</pre>"

Because subject prefixes are absent, personal pronouns are very frequently used to indicate the subject.\n\nThe habitual aspect with hu- is often replaced by the present with -na- in everyday use, the sisi hunywa of the above example then being replaced with tunakunywa. In order to maintain the habitual meaning, the word huwa (the habitual form of kuwa \"to be\") may precede the verb, such as Huwa tunakunywa. This may be regarded as an example of a compound tense, however because of the invariability of huwa, it may also be regarded simply as an adverb with the meaning \"habitually\".\nIn the informal speech of some regions, speakers instead make frequent use of the non-standard habitual suffix -ga or -nga, which has entered Swahili from other Bantu languages spoken in East Africa, giving forms such as tunakunywaga or tunakunywanga for \"we habitually drink\". These suffixes mean either the performance of an action as a habit or that it occurs \"once in a while\", as these examples show:\n\nUmewahi kwenda Morogoro? \"Have you ever been to Morogoro?\"\n→ Naendaga \"Yeah, I go there (habitually/from time to time).\nWee unacheza ngoma? \"You do you dance to traditional music?\" (Wee is an informal form of wewe.)\n→ Nachezaga \"Yeah, I do.\"\n→ Sichezagi \"No, I don't.\"\nAlthough there are many ways in which the habitual aspect with hu- is avoided in informal speech, it is, however, very commonly used in proverbs dealing with eternal truisms.\n\nIn generalisations about the habits of groups of people, speakers often synecdochically pair a singular subject with a verb taking the hu- prefix. Mtanzania hulala uchi \"A Tanzanian sleeps naked.\" (\"Tanzanians sleep naked.\") Informally, however, the present tense with -na- may be used in this way as well: Mfaransa anakula chura, \"A French person eats frogs.\" (\"French people eat frogs.\") Pointing out an eagle hovering above a hamlet, Yule mtu anakula kuku, \"That type of guy eats chicken.\""

Some speakers may use the extension -ku- with -ja-.\nSome sources describe the -ja- form as containing more of an implication of \"not yet\" than a simple negation of the -me- form, however the word bado \"still\", \"not yet\" may be used to indicate this explicitly where necessary.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Perfect > ##### Table 33: Formation of the perfect tense\n\n<pre>```\n| Unnamed: 0       | Common Verb           | Short Verb            | Loan verb            |\n|:-----------------|:----------------------|:----------------------|:---------------------|\n| positive perfect | [SUBJ]me___a          | [SUBJ]meku___a        | [SUBJ]me___          |\n| positive perfect | [SUBJ]me[OBJ]___a     | [SUBJ]me[OBJ]___a     | [SUBJ]me[OBJ]___     |\n| negative perfect | [NEG.SUBJ]ja___a      | [NEG.SUBJ]ja(ku)___a  | [NEG.SUBJ]ja___      |\n| negative perfect | [NEG.SUBJ]ja[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]ja[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]ja[OBJ]___ |\n```</pre>\n\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Perfect > ##### Table 34: Examples\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb    | Example                            | Notes                                              |\n|:--------|:-----------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|\n| -enda   | Amekwenda. \"She has gone/been.\"    | Ameenda is also used.                              |\n| -enda   | Hajaenda. \"She hasn't gone/been.\"  | nan                                                |\n| -la     | Nimekula. \"I have eaten.\"          | Short verb: -ku- prevents -me- from being stressed |\n| -la     | Sijala. \"I haven't eaten.\"         | Sijakula may also be encountered.                  |\n| -andika | Umeandika. \"You have written.\"     | nan                                                |\n| -andika | Hujaandika. \"You haven't written.\" | nan                                                |\n| -jibu   | Tumejibu. \"We have answered.\"      | nan                                                |\n| -jibu   | Hatujajibu. \"We haven't answered.\" | nan                                                |\n```</pre>\n\n\nInchoative verbs, such as kuchoka \"to get tired\", which describe the entering of a state, are used in the perfect to indicate being in the state in question.

A number of speakers, however, use -to- in the negative future. This may be derived by analogy from the -to- of the negative infinitive, and may also disambiguate between positive and negative where the only difference otherwise would be an h- at the beginning of the negative word. For example, atakuja \"s/he will come\" vs. hatakuja \"s/he will not come\" (or hatokuja). Because second language speakers in many areas have trouble with pronouncing and distinguishing /h/, the optional change from -ta- to -to- in the negative can provide a failsafe indication when a negative meaning is intended.\n-Ta- (and likewise -to-) cannot take the word stress whether in positive or negative and thus causes the appearance of the -ku- extension in short verbs.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Future > ##### Table 36: Formation of the future tense\n\n<pre>```\n| Unnamed: 0                | Common Verb           | Short Verb            | Loan verb            |\n|:--------------------------|:----------------------|:----------------------|:---------------------|\n| positive future           | [SUBJ]ta___a          | [SUBJ]taku___a        | [SUBJ]ta___          |\n| positive future           | [SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___a     | [SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___a     | [SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___     |\n| negative future (usual)   | [NEG.SUBJ]ta___a      | [NEG.SUBJ]taku___a    | [NEG.SUBJ]ta___      |\n| negative future (usual)   | [NEG.SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___ |\n| negative future (variant) | [NEG.SUBJ]to___a      | [NEG.SUBJ]toku___a    | [NEG.SUBJ]to___      |\n| negative future (variant) | [NEG.SUBJ]to[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]to[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]to[OBJ]___ |\n```</pre>\n\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Future > ##### Table 37: Examples\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb    | Example                        | Notes                                              |\n|:--------|:-------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|\n| -enda   | Atakwenda. \"She will go.\"      | Ataenda is also used.                              |\n| -enda   | Hatakwenda. \"She won't go.\"    | Hataenda is also used.                             |\n| -la     | Nitakula. \"I will eat.\"        | Short verb: -ku- prevents -ta- from being stressed |\n| -la     | Sitakula. \"I won't eat.\"       | Short verb: -ku- prevents -ta- from being stressed |\n| -andika | Utaandika. \"You will write.\"   | nan                                                |\n| -andika | Hutaandika. \"You won't write.\" | nan                                                |\n| -jibu   | Tutajibu. \"We will answer.\"    | nan                                                |\n| -jibu   | Hatutajibu. \"We won't answer.\" | nan                                                |\n```</pre>"

It is somewhat equivalent to the English conjunctions \"if\" and \"when\", but it also forms the equivalent of adverbial participle clauses. If needed for clarity or emphasis, a word meaning if, such as kama, ikiwa or endapo may be added to the beginning of the clause (which allows the speaker to choose a different TAM marker). The word ikiwa is itself the situational form of the verb -wa \"to be\", with the class 9 subject prefix i-, literally meaning on its own essentially \"if it is\".\n\nThe situational may appear in compound progressive tenses."

Note that class 1 has the most irregularity and diversity of form.\n\n## Determiners > ### Other determiners > #### Table 18\n\n<pre>```\n|   Class | Determiners + -ote \"all\"[5]   | Determiners + -o-ote \"any\"   | Determiners + -pi \"which\"[5]   | Determiners + -enyewe \"self\", \"selves\"   | Prepositions + -a \"of\"   | Prepositions + -enye \"having\"   | Verbal Prefix + Subject   |\n|--------:|:------------------------------|:-----------------------------|:-------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|:-------------------------|:--------------------------------|:--------------------------|\n|       1 | —                             | yeyote                       | yupi                           | mwenyewe                                 | wa                       | mwenye                          | a- / yu-                  |\n|       2 | wote [a]                      | wowote                       | wepi [b] ( / wapi[6])          | wenyewe                                  | wa                       | wenye                           | wa-                       |\n|       3 | wote                          | wowote                       | upi                            | wenyewe                                  | wa                       | wenye                           | u-                        |\n|       4 | yote                          | yoyote                       | ipi                            | yenyewe                                  | ya                       | yenye                           | i-                        |\n|       5 | lote                          | lolote                       | lipi                           | lenyewe                                  | la                       | lenye                           | li-                       |\n|       6 | yote                          | yoyote                       | yapi                           | yenyewe                                  | ya                       | yenye                           | ya-                       |\n|       7 | chote                         | chochote                     | kipi                           | chenyewe                                 | cha                      | chenye                          | ki-                       |\n|       8 | vyote                         | vyovyote                     | vipi [c]                       | vyenyewe                                 | vya                      | vyenye                          | vi-                       |\n|       9 | yote                          | yoyote                       | ipi                            | yenyewe                                  | ya                       | yenye                           | i-                        |\n|      10 | zote                          | zozote                       | zipi                           | zenyewe                                  | za                       | zenye                           | zi-                       |\n|      11 | wote                          | wowote                       | upi                            | wenyewe                                  | wa                       | wenye                           | u-                        |\n|      14 | wote                          | wowote                       | upi                            | wenyewe                                  | wa                       | wenye                           | u-                        |\n|      15 | kote / kwote                  | kokote / kwokwote            | kupi                           | kwenyewe                                 | kwa                      | kwenye                          | ku-                       |\n|      16 | pote                          | popote                       | wapi [d] ( / papi[6])          | penyewe                                  | pa                       | penye                           | pa-                       |\n|      17 | kote / kwote                  | kokote / kwokwote            | kupi                           | kwenyewe                                 | kwa                      | kwenye                          | ku-                       |\n|      18 | mote / mwote                  | momote / mwomwote            | mpi [7]                        | mwenyewe                                 | mwa                      | mwenye                          | m(u)-                     |\n```</pre>"

All together, Tense, Aspect and Mood may be abbreviated as TAM.\nThe following table shows a summary of TAM forms which will be discussed in further depth below. Brackets indicate optional elements and slashes indicate alternative elements of which either (but not both) may fill the same slot in the verb. The column labelled 'final vowel' is only relevant for \"short\" and \"common verbs\", with \"loan verbs\" remaining invariable here with the exception of the -ni suffix added to indicate 2nd person plural address. In any TAM form, when the object is 2nd person plural, this -(e)ni prefix may also occur, but this is not shown in this table.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Table 24: Summary of

Note that the ji- prefix of reflexive verbs is an object prefix, meaning, for example, that the imperative of -jifunza \"to learn\" is jifunze \"learn!\" and not *jifunza.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Imperative > ##### Table 25: Formation of the imperative\n\n<pre>```\n| Unnamed: 0   | Common verbs   | Short verbs   | Loan verb   |\n|:-------------|:---------------|:--------------|:------------|\n| Singular     | ___a           | ku___a        | ___         |\n| Singular     | [OBJ]___e      | [OBJ]___e     | [OBJ]___    |\n| Plural       | ___eni         | ku___eni      | ___ni       |\n| Plural       | [OBJ]___eni    | [OBJ]___eni   | [OBJ]___ni  |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe plural form, with the suffix -ni, is used when addressing multiple people.\nThe following verbs have irregular imperatives, regular forms may be heard, particularly by non-native speakers and particularly in Kenya, and regular forms may be interpreted as less polite:\n\nkuja \"to come\": njoo (pl. njooni)\nkwenda \"to go\" : nenda (pl. nendeni)\nkuleta \"to bring\": lete (pl. leteni)\nThe verb -acha may informally be given the imperative form wacha (pl. wacheni).\nAdditionally, the verb kuwa \"to be\" has an irregular imperative form: iwe (pl. iweni), although this is rarely used and more frequently replaced by a regular imperative form kuwa (pl. kuweni) or used in the subjunctive (\"polite imperative\") form: uwe (pl. mwe).\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Imperative > ##### Table 26: Examples (singular then plural)\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb     | Alone                       | With object                             |\n|:---------|:----------------------------|:----------------------------------------|\n| -nywa    | Kunywa!

The equivalent is achieved with the negative subjunctive (as in Spanish). The formation of this is outlined below, but for the sake of completeness the negative equivalents of the above examples are given here.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Imperative > ##### Table 27: Examples (singular then plural)\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb     | Alone                                 | With object                                       |\n|:---------|:--------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|\n| -nywa    | Usinywe!

Msijifunze! \"Don't learn!\"            |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe suffix -ni is used when the order is addressed to each of the people. When an order is given to any of the addressed persons the subjunctive mood is used.\nFor instance when a load is meant to be carried, if it is heavy and all the people should help, Bebeni mzigo. When anyone could help carrying on their own Mbebe mzigo. When introducing people in a waiting room, Mkae hapa implies that all the people will be called together. Kaeni hapa implies that anyone could sit and they will be called one by one. The suffix -ni is thus the locative suffix which specifies that the order is given to everyone, distinctly in the time-space."

In modern, standard Swahili, however, there is no great difference in meaning between these two forms as the \"indefinite present\" is more or less obsolete and rarely used other than its frequent appearance in media headlines.

The distinction between the \"definite\" and \"indefinite\" present tense forms appears to vanish in the first person as both begin with a na-, however short verbs retain their -ku- extension in the -na- tense and lose it in the -a- tense, allowing this distinction to still be felt, such as in (ni)nakula \"I eat\", in the -na- present tense, versus nala \"I eat\", in the -a- present tense.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Present tenses > ##### Table 29: Examples (\"definite\", \"indefinite\", negative)\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb    | Example                                                | Notes                                                              |\n|:--------|:-------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| -enda   | Anakwenda. \"She goes\" / \"She's going.\"                 | (Anaenda is also used.)                                            |\n| -enda   | Aenda. \"She goes.\"                                     | nan                                                                |\n| -enda   | Haendi. \"She doesn't go.\" / \"She isn't going.\"         | nan                                                                |\n| -la     | (Ni)nakula. \"I eat.\" / \"I am eating.\"                  | Short verb: -ku- prevents -na- from being stressed                 |\n| -la     | Nala. \"I eat.\"                                         | Short verb: -a- has no problem taking stress.                      |\n| -la     | Sili. \"I'm not eating.\" / \"I don't eat.\"               | Short verb: si-, like all subject/object prefixes, can take stress |\n| -andika | Unaandika. \"You write.\" / \"You are writing.\"           | nan                                                                |\n| -andika | Waandika. \"You write.\"                                 | May also mean \"They write.\" U- + a- = wa-; wa- + -a- = wa-         |\n| -andika | Huandiki. \"You don't write.\" / \"You aren't writing.\"   | nan                                                                |\n| -jibu   | Tunajibu. \"We answer\" / \"We are answering.\"            | nan                                                                |\n| -jibu   | Twajibu. \"We answer.\"                                  | nan                                                                |\n| -jibu   | Hatujibu. \"We don't answer.\" / \"We are not answering.\" | Loan verb, no -a suffix to be changed to -i.                       |\n```</pre>"

Because subject prefixes are absent, personal pronouns are very frequently used to indicate the subject.\n\nThe habitual aspect with hu- is often replaced by the present with -na- in everyday use, the sisi hunywa of the above example then being replaced with tunakunywa. In order to maintain the habitual meaning, the word huwa (the habitual form of kuwa \"to be\") may precede the verb, such as Huwa tunakunywa. This may be regarded as an example of a compound tense, however because of the invariability of huwa, it may also be regarded simply as an adverb with the meaning \"habitually\".\nIn the informal speech of some regions, speakers instead make frequent use of the non-standard habitual suffix -ga or -nga, which has entered Swahili from other Bantu languages spoken in East Africa, giving forms such as tunakunywaga or tunakunywanga for \"we habitually drink\". These suffixes mean either the performance of an action as a habit or that it occurs \"once in a while\", as these examples show:\n\nUmewahi kwenda Morogoro? \"Have you ever been to Morogoro?\"\n→ Naendaga \"Yeah, I go there (habitually/from time to time).\nWee unacheza ngoma? \"You do you dance to traditional music?\" (Wee is an informal form of wewe.)\n→ Nachezaga \"Yeah, I do.\"\n→ Sichezagi \"No, I don't.\"\nAlthough there are many ways in which the habitual aspect with hu- is avoided in informal speech, it is, however, very commonly used in proverbs dealing with eternal truisms.\n\nIn generalisations about the habits of groups of people, speakers often synecdochically pair a singular subject with a verb taking the hu- prefix. Mtanzania hulala uchi \"A Tanzanian sleeps naked.\" (\"Tanzanians sleep naked.\") Informally, however, the present tense with -na- may be used in this way as well: Mfaransa anakula chura, \"A French person eats frogs.\" (\"French people eat frogs.\") Pointing out an eagle hovering above a hamlet, Yule mtu anakula kuku, \"That type of guy eats chicken.\""

A number of speakers, however, use -to- in the negative future. This may be derived by analogy from the -to- of the negative infinitive, and may also disambiguate between positive and negative where the only difference otherwise would be an h- at the beginning of the negative word. For example, atakuja \"s/he will come\" vs. hatakuja \"s/he will not come\" (or hatokuja). Because second language speakers in many areas have trouble with pronouncing and distinguishing /h/, the optional change from -ta- to -to- in the negative can provide a failsafe indication when a negative meaning is intended.\n-Ta- (and likewise -to-) cannot take the word stress whether in positive or negative and thus causes the appearance of the -ku- extension in short verbs.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Future > ##### Table 36: Formation of the future tense\n\n<pre>```\n| Unnamed: 0                | Common Verb           | Short Verb            | Loan verb            |\n|:--------------------------|:----------------------|:----------------------|:---------------------|\n| positive future           | [SUBJ]ta___a          | [SUBJ]taku___a        | [SUBJ]ta___          |\n| positive future           | [SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___a     | [SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___a     | [SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___     |\n| negative future (usual)   | [NEG.SUBJ]ta___a      | [NEG.SUBJ]taku___a    | [NEG.SUBJ]ta___      |\n| negative future (usual)   | [NEG.SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___ |\n| negative future (variant) | [NEG.SUBJ]to___a      | [NEG.SUBJ]toku___a    | [NEG.SUBJ]to___      |\n| negative future (variant) | [NEG.SUBJ]to[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]to[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]to[OBJ]___ |\n```</pre>\n\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Future > ##### Table 37: Examples\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb    | Example                        | Notes                                              |\n|:--------|:-------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|\n| -enda   | Atakwenda. \"She will go.\"      | Ataenda is also used.                              |\n| -enda   | Hatakwenda. \"She won't go.\"    | Hataenda is also used.                             |\n| -la     | Nitakula. \"I will eat.\"        | Short verb: -ku- prevents -ta- from being stressed |\n| -la     | Sitakula. \"I won't eat.\"       | Short verb: -ku- prevents -ta- from being stressed |\n| -andika | Utaandika. \"You will write.\"   | nan                                                |\n| -andika | Hutaandika. \"You won't write.\" | nan                                                |\n| -jibu   | Tutajibu. \"We will answer.\"    | nan                                                |\n| -jibu   | Hatutajibu. \"We won't answer.\" | nan                                                |\n```</pre>"

Some speakers, however, particularly in speech influenced by southern dialects, negate the irrealis verb forms instead by using the negative subject concords.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Irrealis > ##### Table 48: Formation of the present irrealis\n\n<pre>```\n| Unnamed: 0                          | Common Verb            | Short Verb             | Loan verb             |\n|:------------------------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:----------------------|\n| positive present irrealis           | [SUBJ]nge___a          | [SUBJ]ngeku___a        | [SUBJ]nge___          |\n| positive present irrealis           | [SUBJ]nge[OBJ]___a     | [SUBJ]nge[OBJ]___a     | [SUBJ]nge[OBJ]___     |\n| negative present irrealis           | [SUBJ]singe___a        | [SUBJ]singeku___a      | [SUBJ]singe___        |\n| negative present irrealis           | [SUBJ]singe[OBJ]___a   | [SUBJ]singe[OBJ]___a   | [SUBJ]singe[OBJ]___   |\n| negative present irrealis (variant) | [NEG.SUBJ]nge___a      | [NEG.SUBJ]ngeku___a    | [NEG.SUBJ]nge___      |\n| negative present irrealis (variant) | [NEG.SUBJ]nge[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]nge[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]nge[OBJ]___ |\n```</pre>\n\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Irrealis > ##### Table 49: Formation of the past irrealis\n\n<pre>```\n| Unnamed: 0                       | Common Verb              | Short Verb               | Loan verb               |\n|:---------------------------------|:-------------------------|:-------------------------|:------------------------|\n| positive past irrealis           | [SUBJ]ngali___a          | [SUBJ]ngaliku___a        | [SUBJ]ngali___          |\n| positive past irrealis           | [SUBJ]ngali[OBJ]___a     | [SUBJ]ngali[OBJ]___a     | [SUBJ]ngali[OBJ]___     |\n| negative past irrealis           | [SUBJ]singali___a        | [SUBJ]singaliku___a      | [SUBJ]singali___        |\n| negative past irrealis           | [SUBJ]singali[OBJ]___a   | [SUBJ]singali[OBJ]___a   | [SUBJ]singali[OBJ]___   |\n| negative past irrealis (variant) | [NEG.SUBJ]ngali___a      | [NEG.SUBJ]ngaliku___a    | [NEG.SUBJ]ngali___      |\n| negative past irrealis (variant) | [NEG.SUBJ]ngali[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]ngali[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]ngali[OBJ]___ |\n```</pre>\n\n\nBoth the irrealis forms are used to discuss hypothetical situations, generally within conditional sentences. Both the protasis (if-clause) and apodosis (then-clause) may have an identical structure with the protasis appearing first. In order to disambiguate or emphasise, such as if the clauses are in the reverse order, a word for \"if\" (kama, ikiwa, endapo) may precede the protasis.\n\nIn the usage of many speakers, the distinction between the present and past irrealis forms is somewhat blurred so that the final example above may commonly be spoken as \"(Kama) ningejua hiyo, nisingekuja hapa.\" which, speaking strictly, could be interpreted as \"If I knew that I would not come here.\""

        "content": "The imperative mood is used to issue direct commands. It can occur either alone or with an object prefix. The presence of an object prefix (including the reflexive ji-) causes the final -a of Bantu verbs to become -e. Note that the ji- prefix of reflexive verbs is an object prefix, meaning, for example, that the imperative of -jifunza \"to learn\" is jifunze \"learn!\" and not *jifunza.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Imperative > ##### Table 25: Formation of the imperative\n\n<pre>```\n| Unnamed: 0   | Common verbs   | Short verbs   | Loan verb   |\n|:-------------|:---------------|:--------------|:------------|\n| Singular     | ___a           | ku___a        | ___         |\n| Singular     | [OBJ]___e      | [OBJ]___e     | [OBJ]___    |\n| Plural       | ___eni         | ku___eni      | ___ni       |\n| Plural       | [OBJ]___eni    | [OBJ]___eni   | [OBJ]___ni  |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe plural form, with the suffix -ni, is used when addressing multiple people.\nThe following verbs have irregular imperatives, regular forms may be heard, particularly by non-native speakers and particularly in Kenya, and regular forms may be interpreted as less polite:\n\nkuja \"to come\": njoo (pl. njooni)\nkwenda \"to go\" : nenda (pl. nendeni)\nkuleta \"to bring\": lete (pl. leteni)\nThe verb -acha may informally be given the imperative form wacha (pl. wacheni).\nAdditionally, the verb kuwa \"to be\" has an irregular imperative form: iwe (pl. iweni), although this is rarely used and more frequently replaced by a regular imperative form kuwa (pl. kuweni) or used in the subjunctive (\"polite imperative\") form: uwe (pl. mwe).\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Imperative > ##### Table 26: Examples (singular then plural)\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb     | Alone                       | With object                             |\n|:---------|:----------------------------|:----------------------------------------|\n| -nywa    | Kunywa!

The equivalent is achieved with the negative subjunctive (as in Spanish). The formation of this is outlined below, but for the sake of completeness the negative equivalents of the above examples are given here.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Imperative > ##### Table 27: Examples (singular then plural)\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb     | Alone                                 | With object                                       |\n|:---------|:--------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|\n| -nywa    | Usinywe!

Msijifunze! \"Don't learn!\"            |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe suffix -ni is used when the order is addressed to each of the people. When an order is given to any of the addressed persons the subjunctive mood is used.\nFor instance when a load is meant to be carried, if it is heavy and all the people should help, Bebeni mzigo. When anyone could help carrying on their own Mbebe mzigo. When introducing people in a waiting room, Mkae hapa implies that all the people will be called together. Kaeni hapa implies that anyone could sit and they will be called one by one. The suffix -ni is thus the locative suffix which specifies that the order is given to everyone, distinctly in the time-space."

        "content": "Swahili nouns are grouped into noun classes based on the prefix they have, with each class having a prescribed number. For example, the nouns wasichana \"girls\" and wasimamizi \"overseers\" belong to class 2, characterised by the prefix wa-, whereas kifuniko \"lid, cover\" and kisukari \"diabetes\" belong to class 7, characterised by the prefix ki-. The classes 5, 9 and 10 are frequently without any prefix, such as gari a class-6 noun meaning \"car\" and chupa, meaning \"bottle\" in class 9 and \"bottles\" in class 10. The numbers are based on the classes reconstructed for Proto-Bantu, and have corresponding classes in the other Bantu languages which can be identified by the same system of numbers. Therefore, classes that are missing in Swahili create a gap in the numbering, as is the case with classes above 18 as well as classes 12 and 13, which are absent in standard Swahili (although do frequently occur in non-standard varieties). Tables in this article are labelled not only with the traditional numbering system for Bantu languages but also a simple label based on noun morphology in order to make the tables more accessible to learners, who are generally taught labels for classes such as \"ki/vi\" instead of \"7/8\".\nWhen discussing Swahili noun classes, it is important to distinguish between (1) morphological noun classes as a quality of the noun themselves indicated by morphological features (generally prefixes), and (2) syntactic noun classes as an agreement (i.e. concord) paradigm affecting the use of other words in the sentence. Here, \"noun class\" is used with the former meaning. Morphological and syntactic noun classes often diverge, especially when it comes to nouns referring to people and animals which do not belong to the morphological noun class 1/2, signalled by m-wa. For more information, see concord.\nThe following noun classes exist:\n\n## Nouns > ### Noun classes > #### Table 2\n\n<pre>```\n|   Class | Class + Class.1   | Prefix before... + consonant   | Prefix before... + vowel   | Example                      | Typical meaning                                      |\n|--------:|:------------------|:-------------------------------|:---------------------------|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|\n|       1 | m-                | m-[a]                          | mw-[a]                     | mtu \"person\"                 | Humans, animate / Singular                           |\n|       2 | wa-               | wa-                            | w(a)-[b]                   | watu \"people\"                | Humans, animate / Plural                             |\n|       3 | m-                | m-[a]                          | mw-[a]                     | mti \"tree\"                   | Plants, inanimate / Singular                         |\n|       4 | mi-               | mi-                            | my-                        | miti \"trees\"                 | Plants, inanimate / Plural                           |\n|       5 | ji-               | (ji-)[c]                       | (j-)[c]                    | jicho \"eye\"                  | Various / Singular                                   |\n|       6 | ma-               | ma-                            | ma-[d]                     | macho \"eyes\"                 | Various / Plural                                     |\n|       7 | ki-               | ki-                            | ch-/ki-[e]                 | kitabu \"book\"                | Various, diminutives, manner/way/language / Singular |\n|       8 | vi-               | vi-                            | vy-/vi-[e]                 | vitabu \"books\"               | Various, diminutives, manner/way/language / Plural   |\n|       9 | N-                | n-[f]                          | ny-                        | simba \"lion\"                 | Animals, inanimate / Singular                        |\n|      10 | N-                | n-[f]                          | ny-                        | simba \"lions\", funguo \"keys\" | Animals, inanimate / Plural                          |\n|      11 | u-                | u-                             | u-/uw-/w-[g]               | ufunguo \"key\"                | Things with an extended outline shape                |\n|      14 | u-                | u-                             | u-/uw-/w-[g]               | utu \"humanity\"               | Abstract nouns                                       |\n|      15 | ku-               | ku-                            | ku-/kw-[h]                 | kula \"eating, consuming\"     | Infinitives                                          |\n|      16 | -ni/pa-           | -[i]                           | -[i]                       | mahali \"place\"               | Locatives (proximal, exact)                          |\n|      17 | -ni/ku-           | -[i]                           | -[i]                       | mahali \"place\"               | Locatives (distal, approximate)                      |\n|      18 | -ni/m-            | -[i]                           | -[i]                       | mahali \"place\"               | Locatives (interior)                                 |\n```</pre>\n\n\nEvery class up to 11 can be regarded as inherently singular or plural. Odd-numbered classes are singular, even-numbered classes are plural. The plural of a noun is normally formed by switching it to the next higher class. Thus, the plural of class 1 mtu \"person\" is class 2 watu \"people\". For class 11 nouns, the plural is in class 10. Class 14 usually has no plural at all, but in rare instances class 6 is used to form a plural for these nouns, for example ugonjwa \"sickness, disease\", magonjwa \"diseases\". Class 6 also contains a lot of nouns for liquids, such as maji \"water\", and other nouns derived from verbs such as mazungumzo \"conversation(s)\". Aside from these, there are some nouns in other classes that do not change class to indicate number, such as mchana \"afternoon(s)\", \"daytime\" (class 3), vita \"war(s)\" (class 8), usiku \"night(s)\" (class 14), and these can be shown as singular or plural only by surrounding context.\nIn terms of meaning, groups of similar nouns tend to belong to similar noun classes. For example, nouns for people, including agent nouns, are commonly in classes 1/2, while animals are often in classes 9/10. Nouns describing plants are in class 3/4 and any fruit they produce will probably be in class 5/6. Abstract nouns are often in class 14, loanwords in classes 9/10 and 5/6. Many nouns for liquids are in class 6. Infinitives/gerunds of verbs are in class 15. Diminutives as well as the words for many man-made tools and languages are in class 7/8. These are only generalisations and there are exceptions in most classes."

pattern. The genitive pronominal forms -angu, -ako, -ake, -etu, -enu and -ao are frequently inflected with a group of nouns referring to close human relationships with their appropriate class 9/10 concords, regardless of the fact that they are animate (giving yangu, yako, yetu etc. in singular and zangu, zako, zetu etc. in plural). For some speakers, the same rule applies to the simple genitive preposition -a (giving ya in singular and za in plural), however for most speakers wa is used for all animate nouns regardless of number or class.

        "content": "A locative noun is a derived noun that indicates a location associated with the base noun from which it is derived. The change in meaning can translate to a variety of English prepositions indicating location, such as \"in\", \"at\", \"on\", \"to\" or \"from\", and is thus quite general in meaning, with the exact meaning of the phrase generally being determined by the verb.\nThe Arabic loan noun mahali \"place\" (and its variations: pahali, mahala and pahala) is the only noun which inherently belongs to the locative class. Other nouns can be made locative by adding the suffix -ni to the end, although this is not available for proper nouns referring to places, any animate nouns, recent loanwords and some other arbitrary nouns.\nBecause locative nouns constitute three classes of their own, they cannot take the usual concords of the noun they have been derived from. The concords themselves show in which one of the locative classes the noun is being used. Class 16 is marked by concords based on pa- and indicates specific location. Class 17, with concords based on ku- indicates a more general location. Class 18 has concords based on mu- and indicates internal location.\n\nnyumba ya Rehema \"Rehema's house\" (class 9)\nnyumbani kwa Rehema \"at/to/from Rehema's house\" (class 17)\nchumba cha Daudi \"Daudi's room\" (class 7)\nchumbani mwa Daudi \"in/into/out of Daudi's room\" (class 18)"

        "similarity": 1.0,
        "content": "The equivalent of compound words is usually formed using the genitive construction such as mpira wa kikapu \"basketball\" (literally \"ball of basket\"). This is similar to the compounding process found in many languages such as French fin de semaine \"weekend\" (literally \"end of week\").\nThere are also many compounds which do not use the genitive preposition -a. In these cases, two (or more) nouns are simply placed side by side. This is the case of skilled workpersons such as fundi viatu (shoemaker), fundi baskeli (bicycle mechanics) and so on.\nThe word order is the reverse of most compounds in English, with the head always preceding the modifiers in Swahili; in other words, the first noun describes what it is, and any subsequent noun narrows or specifies that description. For example, the class 9/10 noun punda \"donkey(s)\" is followed by the class 4 noun milia \"stripes\" to mean \"zebra\". Whereas in English, a hypothetical equivalent compound would place the noun for the stripes first and also require the singular: \"stripe-donkey\", the word for \"donkey\" appears first in Swahili.\nThere is a good deal of variation among different authors as to whether the nouns are written together, hyphenated or separated and thus the word for \"zebra(s)\" may appear as any of pundamilia, punda-milia or punda milia.\nA few common compound words have irregular plural forms because number marking occurs on both elements. The word mwanamke \"woman\" becomes wanawake \"women\" in plural. Similarly, mwanamume \"man\" becomes wanaume \"men\" in plural, although the singular form mwanaume is also common. These two nouns are formed from the word mwana \"son, daughter\", which is commonly used in compounds to essentially mean \"person\", followed by the words mke \"wife\" (plural: wake) and mume \"husband\" (plural: waume) respectively."

The passive verb, however, does explicitly allude to the existence of an agent, in contrast to the mediopassive below. When the agent is included in the sentence, it is introduced by the preposition na, which is here the equivalent of the English \"by\", although in other contexts it is more usually equivalent to \"and\" or \"with\"."

        "content": "The imperative mood is used to issue direct commands. It can occur either alone or with an object prefix. The presence of an object prefix (including the reflexive ji-) causes the final -a of Bantu verbs to become -e. Note that the ji- prefix of reflexive verbs is an object prefix, meaning, for example, that the imperative of -jifunza \"to learn\" is jifunze \"learn!\" and not *jifunza.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Imperative > ##### Table 25: Formation of the imperative\n\n<pre>```\n| Unnamed: 0   | Common verbs   | Short verbs   | Loan verb   |\n|:-------------|:---------------|:--------------|:------------|\n| Singular     | ___a           | ku___a        | ___         |\n| Singular     | [OBJ]___e      | [OBJ]___e     | [OBJ]___    |\n| Plural       | ___eni         | ku___eni      | ___ni       |\n| Plural       | [OBJ]___eni    | [OBJ]___eni   | [OBJ]___ni  |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe plural form, with the suffix -ni, is used when addressing multiple people.\nThe following verbs have irregular imperatives, regular forms may be heard, particularly by non-native speakers and particularly in Kenya, and regular forms may be interpreted as less polite:\n\nkuja \"to come\": njoo (pl. njooni)\nkwenda \"to go\" : nenda (pl. nendeni)\nkuleta \"to bring\": lete (pl. leteni)\nThe verb -acha may informally be given the imperative form wacha (pl. wacheni).\nAdditionally, the verb kuwa \"to be\" has an irregular imperative form: iwe (pl. iweni), although this is rarely used and more frequently replaced by a regular imperative form kuwa (pl. kuweni) or used in the subjunctive (\"polite imperative\") form: uwe (pl. mwe).\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Imperative > ##### Table 26: Examples (singular then plural)\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb     | Alone                       | With object                             |\n|:---------|:----------------------------|:----------------------------------------|\n| -nywa    | Kunywa!

The equivalent is achieved with the negative subjunctive (as in Spanish). The formation of this is outlined below, but for the sake of completeness the negative equivalents of the above examples are given here.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Imperative > ##### Table 27: Examples (singular then plural)\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb     | Alone                                 | With object                                       |\n|:---------|:--------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|\n| -nywa    | Usinywe!

Msijifunze! \"Don't learn!\"            |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe suffix -ni is used when the order is addressed to each of the people. When an order is given to any of the addressed persons the subjunctive mood is used.\nFor instance when a load is meant to be carried, if it is heavy and all the people should help, Bebeni mzigo. When anyone could help carrying on their own Mbebe mzigo. When introducing people in a waiting room, Mkae hapa implies that all the people will be called together. Kaeni hapa implies that anyone could sit and they will be called one by one. The suffix -ni is thus the locative suffix which specifies that the order is given to everyone, distinctly in the time-space."

The distinction between the \"definite\" and \"indefinite\" present tense forms appears to vanish in the first person as both begin with a na-, however short verbs retain their -ku- extension in the -na- tense and lose it in the -a- tense, allowing this distinction to still be felt, such as in (ni)nakula \"I eat\", in the -na- present tense, versus nala \"I eat\", in the -a- present tense.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Present tenses > ##### Table 29: Examples (\"definite\", \"indefinite\", negative)\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb    | Example                                                | Notes                                                              |\n|:--------|:-------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| -enda   | Anakwenda. \"She goes\" / \"She's going.\"                 | (Anaenda is also used.)                                            |\n| -enda   | Aenda. \"She goes.\"                                     | nan                                                                |\n| -enda   | Haendi. \"She doesn't go.\" / \"She isn't going.\"         | nan                                                                |\n| -la     | (Ni)nakula. \"I eat.\" / \"I am eating.\"                  | Short verb: -ku- prevents -na- from being stressed                 |\n| -la     | Nala. \"I eat.\"                                         | Short verb: -a- has no problem taking stress.                      |\n| -la     | Sili. \"I'm not eating.\" / \"I don't eat.\"               | Short verb: si-, like all subject/object prefixes, can take stress |\n| -andika | Unaandika. \"You write.\" / \"You are writing.\"           | nan                                                                |\n| -andika | Waandika. \"You write.\"                                 | May also mean \"They write.\" U- + a- = wa-; wa- + -a- = wa-         |\n| -andika | Huandiki. \"You don't write.\" / \"You aren't writing.\"   | nan                                                                |\n| -jibu   | Tunajibu. \"We answer\" / \"We are answering.\"            | nan                                                                |\n| -jibu   | Twajibu. \"We answer.\"                                  | nan                                                                |\n| -jibu   | Hatujibu. \"We don't answer.\" / \"We are not answering.\" | Loan verb, no -a suffix to be changed to -i.                       |\n```</pre>"

Because subject prefixes are absent, personal pronouns are very frequently used to indicate the subject.\n\nThe habitual aspect with hu- is often replaced by the present with -na- in everyday use, the sisi hunywa of the above example then being replaced with tunakunywa. In order to maintain the habitual meaning, the word huwa (the habitual form of kuwa \"to be\") may precede the verb, such as Huwa tunakunywa. This may be regarded as an example of a compound tense, however because of the invariability of huwa, it may also be regarded simply as an adverb with the meaning \"habitually\".\nIn the informal speech of some regions, speakers instead make frequent use of the non-standard habitual suffix -ga or -nga, which has entered Swahili from other Bantu languages spoken in East Africa, giving forms such as tunakunywaga or tunakunywanga for \"we habitually drink\". These suffixes mean either the performance of an action as a habit or that it occurs \"once in a while\", as these examples show:\n\nUmewahi kwenda Morogoro? \"Have you ever been to Morogoro?\"\n→ Naendaga \"Yeah, I go there (habitually/from time to time).\nWee unacheza ngoma? \"You do you dance to traditional music?\" (Wee is an informal form of wewe.)\n→ Nachezaga \"Yeah, I do.\"\n→ Sichezagi \"No, I don't.\"\nAlthough there are many ways in which the habitual aspect with hu- is avoided in informal speech, it is, however, very commonly used in proverbs dealing with eternal truisms.\n\nIn generalisations about the habits of groups of people, speakers often synecdochically pair a singular subject with a verb taking the hu- prefix. Mtanzania hulala uchi \"A Tanzanian sleeps naked.\" (\"Tanzanians sleep naked.\") Informally, however, the present tense with -na- may be used in this way as well: Mfaransa anakula chura, \"A French person eats frogs.\" (\"French people eat frogs.\") Pointing out an eagle hovering above a hamlet, Yule mtu anakula kuku, \"That type of guy eats chicken.\""

The negative subjunctive is indicated by adding the syllable -si- into the tense slot, with the positive subject prefix being used rather than the negative.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods

It is somewhat equivalent to the English conjunctions \"if\" and \"when\", but it also forms the equivalent of adverbial participle clauses. If needed for clarity or emphasis, a word meaning if, such as kama, ikiwa or endapo may be added to the beginning of the clause (which allows the speaker to choose a different TAM marker). The word ikiwa is itself the situational form of the verb -wa \"to be\", with the class 9 subject prefix i-, literally meaning on its own essentially \"if it is\".\n\nThe situational may appear in compound progressive tenses."

In modern, standard Swahili, however, there is no great difference in meaning between these two forms as the \"indefinite present\" is more or less obsolete and rarely used other than its frequent appearance in media headlines. A distinction between these two forms is not made in the negative, with both forms being negated the same way.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Present tenses > ##### Table 28: Formation of the present tense\n\n<pre>```\n| Unnamed: 0                             | Common Verb         | Short Verb          | Loan verb          |\n|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------|:--------------------|:-------------------|\n| \"definite present\"                     | [SUBJ]na___a        | [SUBJ]naku___a      | [SUBJ]na___        |\n| \"definite present\"                     | [SUBJ]na[OBJ]___a   | [SUBJ]na[OBJ]___a   | [SUBJ]na[OBJ]___   |\n| \"indefinite present\" (almost obsolete) | [SUBJ[a]]a___a      | [SUBJ[a]]a___a      | [SUBJ[a]]a___      |\n| \"indefinite present\" (almost obsolete) | [SUBJ[a]]a[OBJ]___a | [SUBJ[a]]a[OBJ]___a | [SUBJ[a]]a[OBJ]___ |\n| negative present                       | [NEG.SUBJ]___i      | [NEG.SUBJ]___i      | [NEG.SUBJ]___      |\n| negative present                       | [NEG.SUBJ][OBJ]___i | [NEG.SUBJ][OBJ]___i | [NEG.SUBJ][OBJ]___ |\n```</pre>\n\n\nIn informal Swahili, it is very common for the first person singular concord ni- to collapse into the -na- of the definite present tense marker and become inaudible (and unwritten).

        "content": "Personal pronouns occur in two forms: an independent form, which is used as a word alone, and a combining stem, which is used when combined with words such as na \"with, and\" and ndi- \"it is\". The independent form consists, in all cases except for wao, of a reduplication of a syllable. Nyinyi, however, may alternatively be dissimilated to ninyi.  These pronouns also have a separate genitive (possessive) stem, which is the combining stem that is used when a genitive prefix is added.\n\n## Pronouns > ### Personal pronouns > #### Table 15\n\n<pre>```\n| Class   | Independent   | Combining suffix   | Genitive suffix   | \"all\"          |\n|:--------|:--------------|:-------------------|:------------------|:---------------|\n| 1S      | mimi          | -mi                | -angu             | —              |\n| 2S      | wewe          | -we                | -ako              | —              |\n| 3S      | yeye          | -ye                | -ake              | —              |\n| 1PL     | sisi          | -si                | -etu              | (sisi) sote    |\n| 2PL     | nyinyi, ninyi | -nyi               | -enu              | (nyinyi) nyote |\n| 3PL     | wao           | -o                 | -ao               | (wao) wote     |\n```</pre>\n\n\nNote that the sex/gender of referents is not distinguished, with yeye capable of meaning either \"he\" or \"she\". These pronouns are, however, restricted to use with animate referents, i.e. people or animals, so it does not generally mean it. The genitive form -ake has no such restriction and may mean \"his\", \"hers\" or \"its\" depending on context. The genitive -ake is also used instead of -ao to mean \"their\" when the referent is inanimate. When the referent is animate, as is most typical, -ao is used.\nThe genitive (or possessive) forms are given prefixes corresponding to the class of the possessed noun which precedes it as shown in the table in the section on the genitive -a, for example kitabu changu \"my book\", vitabu vyangu \"my books\", jina lako \"your name\", majina yao \"their names\". \nSwahili is a pro-drop language. As the verb usually already includes prefixes to indicate the subject and object, personal pronouns are not strictly needed, and are mostly used for emphasis. The exceptions to this include cases when the copula ni (or its negative counterpart si) is used, as well as with the habitual form of the verb, which lacks subject prefixes.\nIn informal speech, when pronouns are unstressed, they may appear in a reduced form, such as mi or mie for mimi, we or wee for wewe etc. This mainly occurs when the pronoun is not added only for emphasis, but is needed (e.g. mi ni \"I am\", informally), and this also frequently occurs where the first person singular subject prefix ni- is dropped in casual speech before -na-. For example, standard (mimi) ninajua \"I know\" often occurs as (mi) najua in spoken Swahili."

        "content": "There are three basic inflection groups which differ only very slightly from one another:\n\ncommon verbs\nshort verbs\nloan verbs\nCommon verbs are the largest group of verbs in Swahili. In their infinitive form, they consist of three or more syllables and end with -a. All verbs of native Bantu origin end with -a, including the short verbs mentioned below. Some examples of common verbs are kuanguka \"to fall\", kufanya \"to do, to make\", kuona \"to see\", kuwaza \"to think\", kusaidia \"to help\". The final -a is replaced with another vowel in certain grammatical contexts, becoming -i in the present negative, and -e in the subjunctive and imperative forms involving an object prefix. The plural address marker -ni also triggers this final -a to become -e.\nShort verbs are those which, in their infinitive form, consist of only two syllables, such as  kula \"to eat\", kunywa \"to drink\", kuja \"to come\", kupa \"to give\". The verbs kwenda \"to go\" and kwisha \"to finish\" may belong to this group, although it is also common for these verbs to be conjugated as common verbs (as kuenda and kuisha). Because the stems of most of these verbs, once the infinitive prefix ku- is removed, are monosyllabic, these are frequently termed monosyllabic verbs, however this is problematic as the final -a of Bantu verbs is often not considered to be part of the root (meaning that roots of many of these verbs consists of only a single consonant or consonant cluster, such as -p- \"give\"). Furthermore, when the final -a is considered part of the stem, this excludes -enda and -isha, which generally conjugate in a similar way to the other short verbs. The short verbs are all native Bantu verbs ending in -a and undergo the same -i and -e alterations as the common verbs. Additionally, they are characterised by the insertion (or retention) of the syllable -ku- in certain verb forms. This intrusive -ku-  (which may be glossed as EXT for \"extension\") prevents the penultimate stress from falling on certain TAM prefixes (-na-, -me-, -li-, -ta-, -sha-, -nge-, -ngeli-) and relative prefixes, which are inherently unable to be stressed. This -ku- disappears in verb forms where the stress is allowed to fall on a subject or object prefix, or on certain other TAM prefixes (-a-, hu-, -ki-, -ka-, -ku-, -si-). (The TAM prefix -ja- can be regarded as belonging to either group, depending on the speaker.) Because the initial stem vowel of -enda and -isha takes the stress, this explanation does not sufficiently fit, however it should suffice to say that the distribution of their -kw- extension, among speakers who use it, is identical to that of the -ku- extension in other short verbs.\nThe Loan verbs, also frequently called \"Arabic\" verbs,  are those which do not end in -a in the infinitive. Not all verbs from Arabic are in this group, however, such as kusaidia, which is an Arabic loan which happens to end in -a and is thus conjugated as a common verb. Likewise, not all Loan verbs come from Arabic, such as kukisi \"to kiss\" and kuripoti \"to report\", which are from English. What these verbs share in common is that they are all loan-words and none of them end in -a. The consequence of this is that they do not take the suffixes -e and -i that the verbs ending in -a do, which occasionally results in ambiguity, such as in si-ku-sahau-Ø which could either mean:"

        "content": "Both the subject and, when applicable, the object of the verb are indicated by prefixes or concords attached to the verb stem. Swahili is a pro-drop language: explicit personal pronouns are only used for emphasis, or with verb forms that do not indicate subject or object. When a noun is used as the subject or object, then the concord must match its class. Animate nouns (referring to a person or animal) are an exception and these occur with concords of the noun classes 1 (singular) or 2 (plural). The subject concord must always be present, except in the infinitive, habitual and imperative forms. The object concord is generally optional; although some sources maintain that it must always be used with animate objects, this appears not to be the case as counter-examples are commonplace. Whether it is used or not appears to have to do with animacy, specificity and definiteness as well as pragmatic considerations of emphasis.\nSix different forms of verbal concord exist.\nFor the subject, there are both negative and positive forms, while there are only positive forms for objects. The negative subject concords are formed by prefixing the syllable ha- to the beginning, except for the irregular forms si- (instead of *hani-), hu- (instead of *hau-) and ha- (instead of *haa-) which are used, respectively, for first, second and third person singular animate subjects.\nAdditionally, in (the third person singular of) noun class 1, the prefix yu- is used instead of a- as the subject of a locative copula. (This yu- can also be seen in the demonstratives.) The negative form of yu- is formed regularly, by appending the prefix ha-.\nBefore the present 'indefinite' marker -a-, subject concords are shortened to just a consonant or consonant cluster in a similar manner to the prefix which occur on the genitive preposition -a.\nObject concords are generally the same as the positive subject concord, although there are a few exceptions for instances involving animate referents; 2nd person singular and plural, as well as 3rd person singular (class 1) all have different forms for subject and object concord.\n\n## Verbs > ### Subject and object

him/her.\" (with emphasis)\nNinampa zawadi. \"I give him/her a gift.\"\nBecause the 2nd person plural object prefix -wa- is the same as the object prefix for class 2 (3rd person plural object), a word such as ninawaona may ambiguously mean \"I see you all\" or \"I see them.\" These two possibilities may be disambiguated by placing the pronoun after the verb: ninawaona ninyi / wao. Very frequently, however, the suffix -eni is appended to the verb to indicate that the second person plural is meant: ninawaoneni \"I see you all.\"  This suffix causes the final a of Bantu verbs to shift to e. On loan verbs, this suffix is simply -ni. Some speakers use the prefix -ku- (otherwise indicating 2nd person singular) with the suffix -(e)ni, as in ninakuoneni \"I see you all.\"\nThe reflexive prefix only occurs as an object, and refers back to the subject of the sentence. It is equivalent to English forms like myself, yourself, himself and so on.\n\nninajitetea \"I defend myself\"\nanajiona \"he sees himself\" (idiomatically, may mean: \"he is conceited\")"

It may occur in the same contexts as other nouns and may, occasionally, even be derived into the locative classes by means of attaching the suffix -ni, as in kuangukani \"in falling\" (i.e. \"while falling\"). It corresponds to the English infinitive or gerund.

        "content": "The imperative mood is used to issue direct commands. It can occur either alone or with an object prefix. The presence of an object prefix (including the reflexive ji-) causes the final -a of Bantu verbs to become -e. Note that the ji- prefix of reflexive verbs is an object prefix, meaning, for example, that the imperative of -jifunza \"to learn\" is jifunze \"learn!\" and not *jifunza.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Imperative > ##### Table 25: Formation of the imperative\n\n<pre>```\n| Unnamed: 0   | Common verbs   | Short verbs   | Loan verb   |\n|:-------------|:---------------|:--------------|:------------|\n| Singular     | ___a           | ku___a        | ___         |\n| Singular     | [OBJ]___e      | [OBJ]___e     | [OBJ]___    |\n| Plural       | ___eni         | ku___eni      | ___ni       |\n| Plural       | [OBJ]___eni    | [OBJ]___eni   | [OBJ]___ni  |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe plural form, with the suffix -ni, is used when addressing multiple people.\nThe following verbs have irregular imperatives, regular forms may be heard, particularly by non-native speakers and particularly in Kenya, and regular forms may be interpreted as less polite:\n\nkuja \"to come\": njoo (pl. njooni)\nkwenda \"to go\" : nenda (pl. nendeni)\nkuleta \"to bring\": lete (pl. leteni)\nThe verb -acha may informally be given the imperative form wacha (pl. wacheni).\nAdditionally, the verb kuwa \"to be\" has an irregular imperative form: iwe (pl. iweni), although this is rarely used and more frequently replaced by a regular imperative form kuwa (pl. kuweni) or used in the subjunctive (\"polite imperative\") form: uwe (pl. mwe).\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Imperative > ##### Table 26: Examples (singular then plural)\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb     | Alone                       | With object                             |\n|:---------|:----------------------------|:----------------------------------------|\n| -nywa    | Kunywa!

The equivalent is achieved with the negative subjunctive (as in Spanish). The formation of this is outlined below, but for the sake of completeness the negative equivalents of the above examples are given here.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Imperative > ##### Table 27: Examples (singular then plural)\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb     | Alone                                 | With object                                       |\n|:---------|:--------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|\n| -nywa    | Usinywe!

Msijifunze! \"Don't learn!\"            |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe suffix -ni is used when the order is addressed to each of the people. When an order is given to any of the addressed persons the subjunctive mood is used.\nFor instance when a load is meant to be carried, if it is heavy and all the people should help, Bebeni mzigo. When anyone could help carrying on their own Mbebe mzigo. When introducing people in a waiting room, Mkae hapa implies that all the people will be called together. Kaeni hapa implies that anyone could sit and they will be called one by one. The suffix -ni is thus the locative suffix which specifies that the order is given to everyone, distinctly in the time-space."

In modern, standard Swahili, however, there is no great difference in meaning between these two forms as the \"indefinite present\" is more or less obsolete and rarely used other than its frequent appearance in media headlines. A distinction between these two forms is not made in the negative, with both forms being negated the same way.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Present tenses > ##### Table 28: Formation of the present tense\n\n<pre>```\n| Unnamed: 0                             | Common Verb         | Short Verb          | Loan verb          |\n|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------|:--------------------|:-------------------|\n| \"definite present\"                     | [SUBJ]na___a        | [SUBJ]naku___a      | [SUBJ]na___        |\n| \"definite present\"                     | [SUBJ]na[OBJ]___a   | [SUBJ]na[OBJ]___a   | [SUBJ]na[OBJ]___   |\n| \"indefinite present\" (almost obsolete) | [SUBJ[a]]a___a      | [SUBJ[a]]a___a      | [SUBJ[a]]a___      |\n| \"indefinite present\" (almost obsolete) | [SUBJ[a]]a[OBJ]___a | [SUBJ[a]]a[OBJ]___a | [SUBJ[a]]a[OBJ]___ |\n| negative present                       | [NEG.SUBJ]___i      | [NEG.SUBJ]___i      | [NEG.SUBJ]___      |\n| negative present                       | [NEG.SUBJ][OBJ]___i | [NEG.SUBJ][OBJ]___i | [NEG.SUBJ][OBJ]___ |\n```</pre>\n\n\nIn informal Swahili, it is very common for the first person singular concord ni- to collapse into the -na- of the definite present tense marker and become inaudible (and unwritten). The distinction between the \"definite\" and \"indefinite\" present tense forms appears to vanish in the first person as both begin with a na-, however short verbs retain their -ku- extension in the -na- tense and lose it in the -a- tense, allowing this distinction to still be felt, such as in (ni)nakula \"I eat\", in the -na- present tense, versus nala \"I eat\", in the -a- present tense.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Present tenses > ##### Table 29: Examples (\"definite\", \"indefinite\", negative)\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb    | Example                                                | Notes                                                              |\n|:--------|:-------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| -enda   | Anakwenda. \"She goes\" / \"She's going.\"                 | (Anaenda is also used.)                                            |\n| -enda   | Aenda. \"She goes.\"                                     | nan                                                                |\n| -enda   | Haendi. \"She doesn't go.\" / \"She isn't going.\"         | nan                                                                |\n| -la     | (Ni)nakula. \"I eat.\" / \"I am eating.\"                  | Short verb: -ku- prevents -na- from being stressed                 |\n| -la     | Nala. \"I eat.\"                                         | Short verb: -a- has no problem taking stress.                      |\n| -la     | Sili. \"I'm not eating.\" / \"I don't eat.\"               | Short verb: si-, like all subject/object prefixes, can take stress |\n| -andika | Unaandika. \"You write.\" / \"You are writing.\"           | nan                                                                |\n| -andika | Waandika. \"You write.\"                                 | May also mean \"They write.\" U- + a- = wa-; wa- + -a- = wa-         |\n| -andika | Huandiki. \"You don't write.\" / \"You aren't writing.\"   | nan                                                                |\n| -jibu   | Tunajibu. \"We answer\" / \"We are answering.\"            | nan                                                                |\n| -jibu   | Twajibu. \"We answer.\"                                  | nan                                                                |\n| -jibu   | Hatujibu. \"We don't answer.\" / \"We are not answering.\" | Loan verb, no -a suffix to be changed to -i.                       |\n```</pre>"

Because subject prefixes are absent, personal pronouns are very frequently used to indicate the subject.\n\nThe habitual aspect with hu- is often replaced by the present with -na- in everyday use, the sisi hunywa of the above example then being replaced with tunakunywa. In order to maintain the habitual meaning, the word huwa (the habitual form of kuwa \"to be\") may precede the verb, such as Huwa tunakunywa. This may be regarded as an example of a compound tense, however because of the invariability of huwa, it may also be regarded simply as an adverb with the meaning \"habitually\".\nIn the informal speech of some regions, speakers instead make frequent use of the non-standard habitual suffix -ga or -nga, which has entered Swahili from other Bantu languages spoken in East Africa, giving forms such as tunakunywaga or tunakunywanga for \"we habitually drink\". These suffixes mean either the performance of an action as a habit or that it occurs \"once in a while\", as these examples show:\n\nUmewahi kwenda Morogoro? \"Have you ever been to Morogoro?\"\n→ Naendaga \"Yeah, I go there (habitually/from time to time).\nWee unacheza ngoma? \"You do you dance to traditional music?\" (Wee is an informal form of wewe.)\n→ Nachezaga \"Yeah, I do.\"\n→ Sichezagi \"No, I don't.\"\nAlthough there are many ways in which the habitual aspect with hu- is avoided in informal speech, it is, however, very commonly used in proverbs dealing with eternal truisms.\n\nIn generalisations about the habits of groups of people, speakers often synecdochically pair a singular subject with a verb taking the hu- prefix. Mtanzania hulala uchi \"A Tanzanian sleeps naked.\" (\"Tanzanians sleep naked.\") Informally, however, the present tense with -na- may be used in this way as well: Mfaransa anakula chura, \"A French person eats frogs.\" (\"French people eat frogs.\") Pointing out an eagle hovering above a hamlet, Yule mtu anakula kuku, \"That type of guy eats chicken.\""

For example, the word nimepika \"I have cooked\" describes a past action with present relevance (i.e. the food is ready now) whereas nilipika \"I cooked\" describes a past action with no implication of any relevance to the present (the food may have been eaten long ago, or not).\nThe perfect is formed in the positive with the prefix -me-. The negative is formed with the negative subject prefix plus -ja-. As with the present and past tenses, the positive present marker -me- cannot take the word stress and triggers the appearance of the -ku- extension in short verbs, but the negative marker -ja- is able to be stressed. Some speakers may use the extension -ku- with -ja-.\nSome sources describe the -ja- form as containing more of an implication of \"not yet\" than a simple negation of the -me- form, however the word bado \"still\", \"not yet\" may be used to indicate this explicitly where necessary.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Perfect > ##### Table 33: Formation of the perfect tense\n\n<pre>```\n| Unnamed: 0       | Common Verb           | Short Verb            | Loan verb            |\n|:-----------------|:----------------------|:----------------------|:---------------------|\n| positive perfect | [SUBJ]me___a          | [SUBJ]meku___a        | [SUBJ]me___          |\n| positive perfect | [SUBJ]me[OBJ]___a     | [SUBJ]me[OBJ]___a     | [SUBJ]me[OBJ]___     |\n| negative perfect | [NEG.SUBJ]ja___a      | [NEG.SUBJ]ja(ku)___a  | [NEG.SUBJ]ja___      |\n| negative perfect | [NEG.SUBJ]ja[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]ja[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]ja[OBJ]___ |\n```</pre>\n\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Perfect > ##### Table 34: Examples\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb    | Example                            | Notes                                              |\n|:--------|:-----------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|\n| -enda   | Amekwenda. \"She has gone/been.\"    | Ameenda is also used.                              |\n| -enda   | Hajaenda. \"She hasn't gone/been.\"  | nan                                                |\n| -la     | Nimekula. \"I have eaten.\"          | Short verb: -ku- prevents -me- from being stressed |\n| -la     | Sijala. \"I haven't eaten.\"         | Sijakula may also be encountered.                  |\n| -andika | Umeandika. \"You have written.\"     | nan                                                |\n| -andika | Hujaandika. \"You haven't written.\" | nan                                                |\n| -jibu   | Tumejibu. \"We have answered.\"      | nan                                                |\n| -jibu   | Hatujajibu. \"We haven't answered.\" | nan                                                |\n```</pre>\n\n\nInchoative verbs, such as kuchoka \"to get tired\", which describe the entering of a state, are used in the perfect to indicate being in the state in question.

For example, atakuja \"s/he will come\" vs. hatakuja \"s/he will not come\" (or hatokuja). Because second language speakers in many areas have trouble with pronouncing and distinguishing /h/, the optional change from -ta- to -to- in the negative can provide a failsafe indication when a negative meaning is intended.\n-Ta- (and likewise -to-) cannot take the word stress whether in positive or negative and thus causes the appearance of the -ku- extension in short verbs.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Future > ##### Table 36: Formation of the future tense\n\n<pre>```\n| Unnamed: 0                | Common Verb           | Short Verb            | Loan verb            |\n|:--------------------------|:----------------------|:----------------------|:---------------------|\n| positive future           | [SUBJ]ta___a          | [SUBJ]taku___a        | [SUBJ]ta___          |\n| positive future           | [SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___a     | [SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___a     | [SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___     |\n| negative future (usual)   | [NEG.SUBJ]ta___a      | [NEG.SUBJ]taku___a    | [NEG.SUBJ]ta___      |\n| negative future (usual)   | [NEG.SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]ta[OBJ]___ |\n| negative future (variant) | [NEG.SUBJ]to___a      | [NEG.SUBJ]toku___a    | [NEG.SUBJ]to___      |\n| negative future (variant) | [NEG.SUBJ]to[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]to[OBJ]___a | [NEG.SUBJ]to[OBJ]___ |\n```</pre>\n\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Future > ##### Table 37: Examples\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb    | Example                        | Notes                                              |\n|:--------|:-------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|\n| -enda   | Atakwenda. \"She will go.\"      | Ataenda is also used.                              |\n| -enda   | Hatakwenda. \"She won't go.\"    | Hataenda is also used.                             |\n| -la     | Nitakula. \"I will eat.\"        | Short verb: -ku- prevents -ta- from being stressed |\n| -la     | Sitakula. \"I won't eat.\"       | Short verb: -ku- prevents -ta- from being stressed |\n| -andika | Utaandika. \"You will write.\"   | nan                                                |\n| -andika | Hutaandika. \"You won't write.\" | nan                                                |\n| -jibu   | Tutajibu. \"We will answer.\"    | nan                                                |\n| -jibu   | Hatutajibu. \"We won't answer.\" | nan                                                |\n```</pre>"

Kitabu hichi ndicho nikitafutacho This the book I look around (I've been seeking for ages). It is also used in some copula Kitabu nilicho nacho The book I am with (the book which is with me).\nThe tensed aspect is connected to a specific time either in the present, the future or in the past. Therefore it is used with a definite past -li- and not with the recent past -me-. The relative is the same expressing the subject (who) or the object (that, which).\n\nKitu kilichonipendeza The thing which pleased me\nKitu nilichokipenda The thing I liked\nChagua matunda yale yaliyoiva Choose the fruit the ones which are ripe.\nChagua yale uliyoweka pembeni Choose the ones you put aside.\n\"Kituo kinachofuata Faya\" The next stop (which follows) is Fire.\nYule aliyekuja sasa hivi kashaondoka The one who came at the moment has gone already.\nWanaokaa hapa wazee The ones who are seated here are the Elders.\nThe periphrastic relative amba- was coined a hundred years ago by foreigners who did not like much the affix -o- and its nuances. It is nowadays widely spread in big cities like Dar, the north, and in the medias like the radio and the television. In many villages it is understood but not used. Amba- is followed by a suffix with the same agreements listed above.\n\nKiswahili ni lugha ambayo inaweza kusanya makabila Swahili is a language which can gather the tribes.\nMimi mtu ambaye anapenda utamaduni I'm a guy who likes traditional features.\nBasi ambalo linachelewa sana The bus which is always late."

The forms of this suffix are identical to the relative markers and are given outlined as combining forms here. Occasionally these may be used in conjunction with a following noun for special emphasis.\n\nWhen kuwa na forms a relative clause and the object is relativised, the relative suffix appears on the relative form of kuwa (or alternatively on the relative pronoun amba-) and the identical referential suffix appears on na-."

For example, the verbs kulewa (\"to get drunk\"), kuchoka (\"to become tired\") and kuchelewa (\"to become late\") describe the respective changes to state from \"not drunk\" to \"drunk\", from \"not tired\" to \"tired\" and from \"not late\" to \"late\". These may be regarded as inherently inchoative verbs. There is, however, no equivalent stative verb for each one that would describe being in the state of having completed that process, i.e. \"to be [state]\". Stative meanings such as \"be drunk\", \"be tired\" and \"be late\" are formed by using these inchoative verbs with the perfect marker -me- (or, in the negative, -ja-).

This -z- results from the palatalisation (\"softening\") process outlined above. which was applied to the -l- in these verbs. The -l- was subsequently lost but the -z- was not.\n\n-tangaa \"to become widely known\" → -tangaza \"to announce; proclaim; publicise\"\n-kataa \"to refuse\" → -kataza \"to forbid\"; cf. -katalisha \"to make (somebody) refuse\"\n-tembea \"to (go for a) walk\" → -tembeza \"to take for a walk; to walk (e.g. a dog)\"\n-kimbia \"to run (away from)\" → -kimbiza \"to chase (away); pursue\"\n-jaa \"to fill; become full\" → -jaza \"to fill; make full\""

For example, the mediopassive verb -vunjika \"to break; go to pieces\" contrasts with its source verb -vunja \"to break; make go to pieces\", not in the quality of being either stative or dynamic — both are dynamic, describing a process that changes over time — but in that the subject of -vunjika is equivalent to the object of -vunja, and the subject of -vunja is completely absent from a clause with -vunjika. In this respect, mediopassive verbs are the same as passive verbs, however they are distinguished by their incompatibility with any mention of an agent. Compare the following three examples.\n\nActive transitive verb (dynamic)\n\nPassive transitive verb (dynamic)\n\nMediopassive verb (dynamic)\n\nMediopassive verbs often have the appearance of being stative when used in the perfect. However, this is a function of the perfect, which focuses on the present relevance of a past action, rather than a function of the mediopassive itself. For example, the sentence \"Dirisha limevunjika\" means either \"The window has broken,\" or \"The window is broken.\" What is being said is that the window broke in the past, but that the effects of this action are still relevant in the present. The verb itself, -vunjika, does not describe the state of being broken, but rather the dynamic process of changing from \"whole; intact\" to \"broken; in pieces\". The perfect -me- here indicates that one is concerned with the state after the dynamic process."

kutegemea to intend are usually followed by the subjunctive even when the subject is the same in both propositions; Nataka niende sokoni I want to go to the market. Mtoto alipewa kitabu asome  The child was given a book so that he could study. Sisi tunategemea tuende picha usiku We've planned to go to the theatre (movies) tonight. It applies when there a possibility of influencing the factors encountered in the context. If there is nothing to do about the context then the infinitive is used.\n\nWale watu wanataka kutawala dunia Those people want to rule the world.\nNataka kukojoa I want to piss\nAnataka kufa  He wants to die (He's going to die)\nWale wageni wanataka kuondoka The guests want to leave\nCompare with: Nataka nikojolee chooni  I want to piss in the toilet. Walitaka waondoke mapema They wanted to leave early (and they didn't wake up) Walitaka kuondoka mapema They wanted to leave early (and the road was flooded)\nAn equivalent of \"must\" or \"have to\" is formed with ni lazima \"it is necessary\", or simply lazima \"necessarily\" followed by the subjunctive. \n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Subjunctive > ##### Table 43\n\n<pre>```\n| 0                                                                                                                    | 1   | 2                                                                                                                                 | 3   | 4                                                                                                                                     |\n|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| (Ni) lazima ulale(ni)(COP)lazimanecessaryu-lal-e2S.SBJ-sleep-SBJV\"You must sleep.\" \"It is necessary that you sleep.\" | ↔   | Si lazima ulalesiNEG.COPlazimanecessarilyu-lal-e2S.SBJ-sleep-SBJV\"You don't have to sleep.\" \"It is not necessary that you sleep.\" | ↔   | (Ni) lazima usilale(ni)(COP)lazimanecessaryu-si-lal-e2S.SBJ-NEG-sleep-SBJV\"You must not sleep.\" \"It is necessary that you not sleep.\" |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe subjunctive may be used on its own with a second person subject as a more polite alternative to an imperative. As there is no negative imperative, forms beginning with usi- and msi- may also be interpreted as such.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses, aspects and moods > #### Subjunctive > ##### Table 44\n\n<pre>```\n| 0                                                       | 1   | 2                                                                                   | 3   | 4                                                                                     |\n|:--------------------------------------------------------|:----|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Toka.Ø-tok(a)-ØIMP-got.out-2S.SBJ\"Go away.\" \"Get lost.\" | ↔   | Utoke.u-tok(a)-e2S.SBJ-go.out-SBJV\"You should go away!\" \"Can you (please) go away!\" | ↔   | Usitoke.u-si-tok(a)-e2S.SBJ-not-go.out-SBJV\"Don't go away!\" \"You should not go away!\" |\n```</pre>"
