Class 8's AC defaults to an additional n that is not present in nouns. The first- and second-person forms are created analogically, by duplicating the vowel in the subject concord and then prefixing a.\nWhen adjective is used predicatively, the first vowel is dropped from the adjective concord. Forms for the first and second person exist as well. These are formed by prefixing the corresponding subject concords (see the verbs section) to the simple noun prefixes of classes 1 (singular) and 2 (plural).\n\n## Adjectives > ### True adjectives (iziphawulo) > #### Table 7\n\n<pre>```\n| Class     | Regular   | Copulative   |\n|:----------|:----------|:-------------|\n| 1st sing. | engim(u)- | ngim(u)-     |\n| 2nd sing. | om(u)-    | um(u)-       |\n| 1st plur. | esiba-    | siba-        |\n| 2nd plur. | eniba-    | niba-        |\n| 1, 1a     | om(u)-    | m(u)-        |\n| 2, 2a     | aba-      | ba-          |\n| 3         | om(u)-    | m(u)-        |\n| 4         | emi-      | mi-          |\n| 5         | eli-      | li-          |\n| 6         | ama-      | ma-          |\n| 7         | esi-      | si-          |\n| 8         | ezin-[c]  | zin-[c]      |\n| 9         | en-[c]    | in-[c]       |\n| 10        | ezin-[c]  | zin-[c]      |\n| 11        | olu-      | lu-          |\n| 14        | obu-      | bu-          |\n| 15        | oku-      | ku-          |\n| 17        | oku-      | ku-          |\n```</pre>\n\n\nExamples:\n\nAbantu abaningi, 'many people'\nAbantu baningi, 'the people are many'\nThat is: abantu is in noun class 2, so it's adjectival concord is aba-, which is attached to -ningi to form abaningi. For 'many dogs' then it results in izinja eziningi, from izinja, 'dogs' (noun class 10) and ezin- (the adjectival concord for noun class 10) + -ningi, 'many', plus phonological conditioning to remove the double n.\n\nUmuntu omdala, 'the old person'\nUmuntu mdala, 'the person is old'\nUmuntu omude, 'the tall person'\nUmuntu mude, 'the person is tall'\nNote that -dala goes with om- and -de with omu- because the long form of the prefix/concord is used when the stem is monosyllabic, else the short one is used.\nAnother example for a class 9 noun with adjectival concord en-:\n\nInja enhle, 'the good dog'\nInja nhle, 'the dog is good'"

        "content": "Both the subject and, when applicable, the object of the verb are indicated by prefixes or concords attached to the verb stem. Zulu is a pro-drop language: explicit personal pronouns are only used for emphasis, while in general the concords on the verb give enough information. When a noun is used as the subject or object, then the concord must match its class. To refer to someone in the third-person, without a noun, classes 1 and 2 are used. The subject concord must always be present, except in the infinitive and imperative forms. The object concord is always optional, even when an explicit object follows the verb.\nFour different kinds of verbal concord exist. For the subject, there are the primary subject, secondary subject and participial subject concords. In addition, a separate set is used for the object. The four are essentially the same if not for tone, except in class 1.\n\nThe primary subject concords (subj1) are used for the subject in all tenses of the positive indicative mood. They are underlyingly low-toned in the first and second person, and high-toned in the remainder.\nSecondary subject concords (subj2) are used for the subject on all verbs marked with negation and on verbs marked for the subjunctive mood. They are all underlyingly high-toned.\nThe participial subject concords (subjP) are present whenever its verb is in participial form. This concord extant on participial verbs is used regardless of the verb's tense. They are identical to the secondary subject concords, except that any final a becomes e.\nThe object concords (obj) are used for the object of the verb, and are only used for transitive verbs and can be used to mark specificity and/or definiteness. They are all underlyingly high-toned.\nThe letters in parentheses indicate additional letters that are added when the prefix is not at the start of the word, functioning to \"save\" the phonology from being violated or to avoid ambiguity.\n\n## Verbs > ### Subject and object concords > #### Table 9\n\n<pre>```\n| Person/ Class   | Primary subject (subj1)   | Secondary subject (subj2)   | Participial subject (subjP)   | Object (obj)   |\n|:----------------|:--------------------------|:----------------------------|:------------------------------|:---------------|\n| 1st sing.       | ngi-                      | ngí-                        | ngí-                          | ngí-           |\n| 2nd sing.       | u-                        | (w)ú-                       | (w)ú-                         | kú-            |\n| 1st plur.       | si-                       | sí-                         | sí-                           | sí-            |\n| 2nd plur.       | ni-                       | ní-                         | ní-                           | ní-            |\n| 1               | ú-                        | (k)á-                       | (k)é-                         | ḿ-             |\n| 2               | bá-                       | bá-                         | bé-                           | bá-            |\n| 3               | ú-                        | (w)ú-                       | (w)ú-                         | wú-            |\n| 4               | í-                        | (y)í-                       | (y)í-                         | yí-            |\n| 5               | lí-                       | lí-                         | lí-                           | lí-            |\n| 6               | á-                        | (w)á-                       | (w)é-                         | wá-            |\n| 7               | sí-                       | sí-                         | sí-                           | sí-            |\n| 8               | zí-                       | zí-                         | zí-                           | zí-            |\n| 9               | í-                        | (y)í-                       | (y)í-                         | yí-            |\n| 10              | zí-                       | zí-                         | zí-                           | zí-            |\n| 11              | lú-                       | lú-                         | lú-                           | lú-            |\n| 14              | bú-                       | bú-                         | bú-                           | bú-            |\n| 15              | kú-                       | kú-                         | kú-                           | kú-            |\n| 17              | kú-                       | kú-                         | kú-                           | kú-            |\n| reflexive       | —                         | —                           | —                             | zí-            |\n```</pre>\n\n\nExamples:\n\nSihamba manje., 'We are going now.'\nThina sihamba manje., 'We are going now.'

However, it is a noun form rather than a verb, so no verb is needed, at least in the present tense.

The subject may or may not be explicitly stated, as usual for verbs. Thus:\n\nínja iy̤isílwane, 'a dog is an animal'\nīkati liy̤isílwane, 'a cat is an animal'\nnginguḿfâzi, 'I am a woman'\nunguḿngani kamama, 'he/she is my mother's friend'\nHowever, when the two things being equated have the same noun class, the subject concord is left out:\n\numúntu ngumúntu ngabántu, 'a person is a person through (other) people'\nThe substantive possessive forms of a noun also have a copulative of their own. They are formed and used in the same way as for the base noun, and always use the prefix ng-.\n\ny̤índlu yómzingéli, 'it's the hunter's house' → ngéyómzingéli, 'it's the hunter's (one)'\ny̤īkhompyutha kábabá, 'it's father's computer' → ngelíkábabá, 'it's father's (one)'\nTo express the negative of the copula, corresponding to English \"is not\" and similar, the prefix a- is added to the subject concord of the existing copulative. The subject concord must therefore always be present; the prefix cannot be added to the bare copulative.\n\nangiy̤isílwane, 'I am not an animal'\nawunguḿngani wámi, 'he/she is not my friend'"

        "content": "The Zulu noun consists of two essential parts: the prefix and the stem. Nouns are grouped into noun classes based on the prefix they have, with each class having a number. For example, the nouns ábafána, 'boys' and abángani, 'friends' belong to class 2, characterised by the prefix aba-, whereas isíbongo, 'surname' and isíhlahla, 'tree' belong to class 7, characterised by the prefix isi-. The numbers are based on the classes reconstructed for Proto-Bantu, and have corresponding classes in the other Bantu languages. Therefore, classes that are missing in Zulu create a gap in the numbering, as is the case with the missing classes 12, 13 and 16, as well as those above 17.\nThe prefix occurs in two forms: the full form and the simple or short form. The full form includes an initial vowel, called the augment, while this vowel is dropped in the simple form. The two forms have different grammatical functions, as detailed below.\n\n## Noun classes > ### Table 1: Zulu noun classes\n\n<pre>```\n| Class   | Full prefix   | Simple prefix   | Common semantic content                                    | Example                               |\n|:--------|:--------------|:----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------|\n| 1       | um(u)-[a]     | m(u)-[a]        | Human beings                                               | umúntu, 'person'                      |\n| 2       | aba-, abe-[b] | ba-, be-[b]     | Regular plural of class 1                                  | abántu, 'people'                      |\n| 1a      | u-            | –               | Proper names, kinship terms, personifications              | úbabá, '(my) father'                  |\n| 2a      | ō-            | bō-             | Regular plural of class 1a                                 | ṓbabá, '(my) fathers'                 |\n| 3       | um(u)-[a]     | m(u)-[a]        | plant, body part, river                                    | uḿlenze, 'leg'                        |\n| 4       | imi-          | mi-             | Regular plural of class 3                                  | imílenze, 'legs'                      |\n| 5       | ī-, ili-      | li-             | Fruit, body part, ethnicity/race (member), loanwords       | ī́qandá, 'egg'                        |\n| 6       | ama-          | ma-             | Regular plural of class 5.                                 | amáqandá, 'eggs'                      |\n| 7       | isi-          | si-             | Object, body part, kind of person, custom/culture/language | isícebi, 'rich person'                |\n| 8       | izi-          | zi-             | Regular plural of class 7                                  | izicêbi, 'rich people'                |\n| 9       | in-[c]        | n-[c]           | Animal                                                     | înjá, 'dog'                           |\n| 10      | izin-[c]      | zin-[c]         | Regular plural of class 9 and 11                           | ízinjá, 'dogs', izimpâphé, 'feathers' |\n| 11      | ū-, ulu-      | lu-             | Long/thin object                                           | ū́phaphé, 'feather'                   |\n| 14      | ubu-          | bu-             | Abstract concept                                           | ubúhlalú, 'bead(s)'                   |\n| 15      | uku-          | ku-             | Infinitive                                                 | ukúkhanya, 'light'                    |\n| 17      | uku-          | ku-             | Relics, locatives, unspecified class                       | úkúdlá, 'food / right hand side'      |\n```</pre>\n\n\nEvery class is inherently singular or plural. Odd-numbered classes are singular, even-numbered classes are plural, with the exception of class 14 which is also singular in meaning. The plural of a noun is normally formed by switching it to the next higher class. Thus, the plural of class 1 umuntu, 'person' is class 2 abantu, 'people'. For class 11 nouns, the plural is class 10. Classes 14, 15 and 17 usually have no plural at all, but in rare instances class 6 is used to form a plural for these nouns.\nThe class of the noun determines the forms of other parts of speech such as verbs and adjectives. These other parts of speech receive their own prefix, matching in class with the noun, though the prefixes themselves are not quite the same:\n\numfana omkhulu, 'big boy'\nisihlahla esikhulu, 'large tree'\nIn terms of meaning, groups of similar nouns tend to belong to similar noun classes. For example, names and surnames are only found in class 1a. Nouns for people, including agent nouns, are commonly in class 1, while animals are often in class 9. Abstract nouns are often in class 14, loanwords in classes 9 and 5, and infinitives of verbs and nouns derived from them in class 15. These are only guidelines and there are exceptions in every single class."

        "similarity": 1.0,
        "content": "Every noun stem (without the prefix) has an inherent tone pattern, where each syllable is inherently high (H) or low (L). For example, the stem -ntu of the noun umúntu has the pattern L (a single low-toned syllable) while the stem -fúbá of the noun ísifûba has an underlying HH pattern (two high-toned syllables). There are several rules which act to modify the underlying tones to produce the final tone pattern that is actually used in speech. Thus, the spoken tones may differ quite strikingly from the underlying tones. This is already evident in the example of ísifûba, where an underlying HH pattern is actually pronounced as FL (falling-low).\nThe prefixes of nouns also have an inherent tone pattern, but this is the same for all nouns and noun classes. The simple prefix has a single L tone, except for class 9 where the simple prefix does not consist of any syllables. The full prefix has an underlying HL pattern (the simple prefix has L, the augment has H), but the single-syllable prefixes of class 5, 9 and 11 have only H. Again, the underlying pattern may be modified by one or more tone rules, as seen in ubúntu, where the underlying prefix is úbu- but surfaces as ubú-.\nThe following tone rules apply to nouns:\n\nPrefix spread: If the penultimate (2nd last) syllable of the prefix is high-toned while the first syllable of the noun stem is low-toned, the high tone spreads rightward to the end of the prefix.\nH-spread: The last high tone in a word, if it occurs before the antepenultimate (3rd last) syllable, will spread rightward to the antepenultimate syllable. If the stem contains no high tones, this rule may apply to a high tone in the prefix as well, causing it to spread onto the stem.\nPhrase-final HH: Where the penultimate (2nd last) syllable is lengthened phrase-finally, if the last two syllables of a word are HH, then if...\nboth syllables belong to the stem, they become FL (falling-low).\nthe former belongs to a one-syllable prefix while the latter belongs to the stem, they become FH (falling-high).\nLeft deletion: In a sequence of high tones that resulted from the spreading rules, all but the last high tone are deleted and replaced by low tones. Any high tones in the stem immediately preceding the last high or falling tone are also deleted, even if they are inherent rather than the result of spreading.\nTone displacement: As described under Zulu phonology.\nTone dissimilation: Any remaining word-final HH pattern becomes HL.\nThese rules are ordered, so that for example the prefix-spread rule applies before the left deletion rule: even if the left deletion rule deletes a high tone from the first syllable of the stem, the prefix spread rule will still operate as though it were still present. Thus, the application of the prefix spread rule can reveal the underlying tone of the first stem syllable. Moreover, the final two syllables are generally not modified by any of the rules, so that the underlying tones are usually readily apparent there. An exception applies for HH in the last two syllables: either the phrase-final HH rule will convert them to FL, the left deletion rule will delete the first H, giving LH, or the tone dissimilation rule will convert it into HL.\nNote that the combination of the spreading rules and the left deletion rule gives the impression of high tone \"shifting\" rightwards. However, chronologically, these are two separate processes, and some other Nguni languages (e.g. certain Xhosa dialects) have the spreading rules but not the deletion rule.\nThe following table shows examples of underlying tone patterns, and the surface patterns that result after application of the rules. The hyphen indicates the boundary between the prefix and the noun stem; the tones of the prefix are shown before the hyphen, those of the noun stem itself after it.\n\n## Noun classes > ### Tone of

combined can often lead to ambiguity as to the underlying tones, especially with longer stems and with class 9 prefixes. For example, the surface-form ínhlamvukâzi could reflect HHLL or LHLL, where the falling tone would be the result of tone displacement, and the first high tone lost due to left deletion. But HHHH, LHHH or LLHH are also possible, with a falling-low final pattern due to phrase-final HH rather than tone displacement. Even HLLL would be possible, with H-spread followed by left deletion and tone displacement creating the falling tone. In this particular case, the noun is known to derive from ínhlâmvu, with a HH pattern, but that still leaves both HHLL and HHHH as possibilities."

        "content": "The locative is a noun form that indicates a location associated with the noun. It can translate to a variety of English prepositions, such as \"in\", \"at\", \"on\", \"to\" or \"from\", and is thus quite general in meaning. The locative is formed in two different ways, depending on the class of the noun.\nFor nouns in class 1(a) or 2(a), which include all proper names of people, the locative is formed by prefixing kú- to the noun, dropping the augment. The prefix has a high tone like the augment, so the tone pattern of the word does not change. For example:\n\numúntu, 'person' → kumúntu, 'at/on/to/from etc. the person'\nabántu, 'people' → kubántu, 'at/on/to/from etc. the people'\núbabá, 'father' → kúbabá, 'at/on/to/from etc. father'\nṓbabá, 'fathers' → kṓbabá, 'at/on/to/from etc. fathers' (u + o gives o)\nu-Okthoba, 'October' → ku-Okthoba, 'in October'\nFor nouns that are not in class 1 or 2, the locative is formed by replacing the augment of the noun with e-, or with o- with class 11 nouns. For most nouns -ini is also suffixed, which causes various changes to the final vowel of the stem. The additional stem syllable also changes the tone pattern.\n\na + ini → eni\ne + ini → eni\ni + ini → ini\no + ini → weni\nu + ini → wini\nSome examples:\n\nuḿlenze, 'leg' → emlénzeni, 'on the leg'\nîsó, 'eye' → êswéni, 'in the eye'\námánzi, 'water' → émánzini, 'in the water'\níndlebé, 'ear' → éndlebéni, 'in the ear'\nínkungú, 'fog' → énkungwíni, 'in the fog'\nū́phahla, 'roof' → ōpháhleni, 'on the roof'\nSome nouns have locative forms without the suffix, using just the prefix. This includes most nouns for place names, but also a few regular nouns:\n\nîGóli, 'Johannesburg' → êGóli, 'in Johannesburg'\nîndlé, 'the wild' → êndlé, 'in the wild'\nîkhânda, 'head' → êkhânda, 'on the head'\nîkhâya, 'home' → êkhâya, 'at home'\núbusûku, 'night' → ébusûku, 'at night'\nínyákatho, 'north' → ényákatho, 'in the north'"

        "content": "The possessive form is similar to the genitive case of some other languages. It indicates the possessor, or a more general association, and corresponds in meaning to the English preposition \"of\".

For example:\n\nū́phahla lwéndlu, 'the roof of the house'\námasôndo êbhási, 'the wheels of the bus'\núkushísa kwoḿlilo, 'the heat of the fire'\nThe possessive prefix is formed from the subject concord of verbs (see the verbs section), plus á. When the possessive prefix is attached to a noun of class 1a (the possessor is class 1a, not the thing possessed), an additional k is infixed, and the subject concord is dropped altogether when it consists of only a vowel.\n\n## Noun classes > ### Possessive > #### Table 3: Zulu possessive prefixes\n\n<pre>```\n| Class   | Prefix   | Prefix + class 1a   |\n|:--------|:---------|:--------------------|\n| 1, 1a   | wá-      | ká-                 |\n| 2, 2a   | bá-      | baká-               |\n| 3       | wá-      | ká-                 |\n| 4       | yá-      | ká-                 |\n| 5       | lá-      | liká-               |\n| 6       | á-       | ká-                 |\n| 7       | sá-      | siká-               |\n| 8       | zá-      | ziká-               |\n| 9       | yá-      | ká-                 |\n| 10      | zá-      | ziká-               |\n| 11      | lwá-     | luká-               |\n| 14      | bá-      | buká-               |\n| 15      | kwá-     | kuká-               |\n| 17      | kwá-     | kuká-               |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe vowel of the prefix coalesces with any initial vowel of the noun, as follows:\n\na + a → a\na + e → e\na + i → e\na + o → o\na + u → o\nFor instance: Isilwane sethu, 'Our animal': formed by sá- (possessive prefix of the class 7 noun isilwane, 'animal') and -íthú (possessive stem of the first person plural personal pronoun).\nWith nouns not in class 1a, the possessive prefix can be attached to either the full form or the simple form of the noun. When attached to the simple form, it has an indefinite meaning, like \"of any\", used with negative verbs. The full form is used in other cases. For example:\n\nangidlánga úkudlá kwênjá, 'I didn't eat the food of the dog' / 'I didn't eat the dog's food'\nangidlánga úkudlá kwânjá, 'I didn't eat the food of any dog' / 'I didn't eat any dog's food'\nWith nouns in class 1a, the prefix, extended with ka, is always attached to the simple form.\nThe possessive form can be extended into a substantive form. It is created by prefixing á-, é- or ó- to the possessive, depending on the noun prefix of the possessed's class: a is used when the possessed noun's prefix begins with a, e when it begins with i, o when it begins with u. In class 6, áw- is prefixed.\n\níndlu yómzingéli, 'the hunter's house' → éyómzingéli, 'the hunter's (one)'\nīkhompyutha likábabá, 'father's computer' → élikábabá, 'father's (one)'"

However, it is a noun form rather than a verb, so no verb is needed, at least in the present tense.

The subject may or may not be explicitly stated, as usual for verbs. Thus:\n\nínja iy̤isílwane, 'a dog is an animal'\nīkati liy̤isílwane, 'a cat is an animal'\nnginguḿfâzi, 'I am a woman'\nunguḿngani kamama, 'he/she is my mother's friend'\nHowever, when the two things being equated have the same noun class, the subject concord is left out:\n\numúntu ngumúntu ngabántu, 'a person is a person through (other) people'\nThe substantive possessive forms of a noun also have a copulative of their own.

The subject concord must therefore always be present; the prefix cannot be added to the bare copulative.\n\nangiy̤isílwane, 'I am not an animal'\nawunguḿngani wámi, 'he/she is not my friend'"

With monosyllabic verbs, or verbs beginning with vowels, contraction only proceeds to level 3 so that the -ku- remains. Note that in the most contracted form, the distinction between immediate and distant future entirely disappears.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses and moods > #### Future tense > ##### Table 21: Examples\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb   | Example                                              |\n|:-------|:-----------------------------------------------------|\n| -za    | Ngizokuza.

        "content": "The Zulu noun consists of two essential parts: the prefix and the stem. Nouns are grouped into noun classes based on the prefix they have, with each class having a number. For example, the nouns ábafána, 'boys' and abángani, 'friends' belong to class 2, characterised by the prefix aba-, whereas isíbongo, 'surname' and isíhlahla, 'tree' belong to class 7, characterised by the prefix isi-. The numbers are based on the classes reconstructed for Proto-Bantu, and have corresponding classes in the other Bantu languages. Therefore, classes that are missing in Zulu create a gap in the numbering, as is the case with the missing classes 12, 13 and 16, as well as those above 17.\nThe prefix occurs in two forms: the full form and the simple or short form. The full form includes an initial vowel, called the augment, while this vowel is dropped in the simple form. The two forms have different grammatical functions, as detailed below.\n\n## Noun classes > ### Table 1: Zulu noun classes\n\n<pre>```\n| Class   | Full prefix   | Simple prefix   | Common semantic content                                    | Example                               |\n|:--------|:--------------|:----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------|\n| 1       | um(u)-[a]     | m(u)-[a]        | Human beings                                               | umúntu, 'person'                      |\n| 2       | aba-, abe-[b] | ba-, be-[b]     | Regular plural of class 1                                  | abántu, 'people'                      |\n| 1a      | u-            | –               | Proper names, kinship terms, personifications              | úbabá, '(my) father'                  |\n| 2a      | ō-            | bō-             | Regular plural of class 1a                                 | ṓbabá, '(my) fathers'                 |\n| 3       | um(u)-[a]     | m(u)-[a]        | plant, body part, river                                    | uḿlenze, 'leg'                        |\n| 4       | imi-          | mi-             | Regular plural of class 3                                  | imílenze, 'legs'                      |\n| 5       | ī-, ili-      | li-             | Fruit, body part, ethnicity/race (member), loanwords       | ī́qandá, 'egg'                        |\n| 6       | ama-          | ma-             | Regular plural of class 5.                                 | amáqandá, 'eggs'                      |\n| 7       | isi-          | si-             | Object, body part, kind of person, custom/culture/language | isícebi, 'rich person'                |\n| 8       | izi-          | zi-             | Regular plural of class 7                                  | izicêbi, 'rich people'                |\n| 9       | in-[c]        | n-[c]           | Animal                                                     | înjá, 'dog'                           |\n| 10      | izin-[c]      | zin-[c]         | Regular plural of class 9 and 11                           | ízinjá, 'dogs', izimpâphé, 'feathers' |\n| 11      | ū-, ulu-      | lu-             | Long/thin object                                           | ū́phaphé, 'feather'                   |\n| 14      | ubu-          | bu-             | Abstract concept                                           | ubúhlalú, 'bead(s)'                   |\n| 15      | uku-          | ku-             | Infinitive                                                 | ukúkhanya, 'light'                    |\n| 17      | uku-          | ku-             | Relics, locatives, unspecified class                       | úkúdlá, 'food / right hand side'      |\n```</pre>\n\n\nEvery class is inherently singular or plural. Odd-numbered classes are singular, even-numbered classes are plural, with the exception of class 14 which is also singular in meaning. The plural of a noun is normally formed by switching it to the next higher class. Thus, the plural of class 1 umuntu, 'person' is class 2 abantu, 'people'. For class 11 nouns, the plural is class 10. Classes 14, 15 and 17 usually have no plural at all, but in rare instances class 6 is used to form a plural for these nouns.\nThe class of the noun determines the forms of other parts of speech such as verbs and adjectives. These other parts of speech receive their own prefix, matching in class with the noun, though the prefixes themselves are not quite the same:\n\numfana omkhulu, 'big boy'\nisihlahla esikhulu, 'large tree'\nIn terms of meaning, groups of similar nouns tend to belong to similar noun classes. For example, names and surnames are only found in class 1a. Nouns for people, including agent nouns, are commonly in class 1, while animals are often in class 9. Abstract nouns are often in class 14, loanwords in classes 9 and 5, and infinitives of verbs and nouns derived from them in class 15. These are only guidelines and there are exceptions in every single class."

        "similarity": 1.0,
        "content": "Every noun stem (without the prefix) has an inherent tone pattern, where each syllable is inherently high (H) or low (L). For example, the stem -ntu of the noun umúntu has the pattern L (a single low-toned syllable) while the stem -fúbá of the noun ísifûba has an underlying HH pattern (two high-toned syllables). There are several rules which act to modify the underlying tones to produce the final tone pattern that is actually used in speech. Thus, the spoken tones may differ quite strikingly from the underlying tones. This is already evident in the example of ísifûba, where an underlying HH pattern is actually pronounced as FL (falling-low).\nThe prefixes of nouns also have an inherent tone pattern, but this is the same for all nouns and noun classes. The simple prefix has a single L tone, except for class 9 where the simple prefix does not consist of any syllables. The full prefix has an underlying HL pattern (the simple prefix has L, the augment has H), but the single-syllable prefixes of class 5, 9 and 11 have only H. Again, the underlying pattern may be modified by one or more tone rules, as seen in ubúntu, where the underlying prefix is úbu- but surfaces as ubú-.\nThe following tone rules apply to nouns:\n\nPrefix spread: If the penultimate (2nd last) syllable of the prefix is high-toned while the first syllable of the noun stem is low-toned, the high tone spreads rightward to the end of the prefix.\nH-spread: The last high tone in a word, if it occurs before the antepenultimate (3rd last) syllable, will spread rightward to the antepenultimate syllable. If the stem contains no high tones, this rule may apply to a high tone in the prefix as well, causing it to spread onto the stem.\nPhrase-final HH: Where the penultimate (2nd last) syllable is lengthened phrase-finally, if the last two syllables of a word are HH, then if...\nboth syllables belong to the stem, they become FL (falling-low).\nthe former belongs to a one-syllable prefix while the latter belongs to the stem, they become FH (falling-high).\nLeft deletion: In a sequence of high tones that resulted from the spreading rules, all but the last high tone are deleted and replaced by low tones. Any high tones in the stem immediately preceding the last high or falling tone are also deleted, even if they are inherent rather than the result of spreading.\nTone displacement: As described under Zulu phonology.\nTone dissimilation: Any remaining word-final HH pattern becomes HL.\nThese rules are ordered, so that for example the prefix-spread rule applies before the left deletion rule: even if the left deletion rule deletes a high tone from the first syllable of the stem, the prefix spread rule will still operate as though it were still present. Thus, the application of the prefix spread rule can reveal the underlying tone of the first stem syllable. Moreover, the final two syllables are generally not modified by any of the rules, so that the underlying tones are usually readily apparent there. An exception applies for HH in the last two syllables: either the phrase-final HH rule will convert them to FL, the left deletion rule will delete the first H, giving LH, or the tone dissimilation rule will convert it into HL.\nNote that the combination of the spreading rules and the left deletion rule gives the impression of high tone \"shifting\" rightwards. However, chronologically, these are two separate processes, and some other Nguni languages (e.g. certain Xhosa dialects) have the spreading rules but not the deletion rule.\nThe following table shows examples of underlying tone patterns, and the surface patterns that result after application of the rules. The hyphen indicates the boundary between the prefix and the noun stem; the tones of the prefix are shown before the hyphen, those of the noun stem itself after it.\n\n## Noun classes > ### Tone of

combined can often lead to ambiguity as to the underlying tones, especially with longer stems and with class 9 prefixes. For example, the surface-form ínhlamvukâzi could reflect HHLL or LHLL, where the falling tone would be the result of tone displacement, and the first high tone lost due to left deletion. But HHHH, LHHH or LLHH are also possible, with a falling-low final pattern due to phrase-final HH rather than tone displacement. Even HLLL would be possible, with H-spread followed by left deletion and tone displacement creating the falling tone. In this particular case, the noun is known to derive from ínhlâmvu, with a HH pattern, but that still leaves both HHLL and HHHH as possibilities."

        ],
        "similarity": 1.0,
        "content": "The locative is a noun form that indicates a location associated with the noun. It can translate to a variety of English prepositions, such as \"in\", \"at\", \"on\", \"to\" or \"from\", and is thus quite general in meaning. The locative is formed in two different ways, depending on the class of the noun.\nFor nouns in class 1(a) or 2(a), which include all proper names of people, the locative is formed by prefixing kú- to the noun, dropping the augment. The prefix has a high tone like the augment, so the tone pattern of the word does not change. For example:\n\numúntu, 'person' → kumúntu, 'at/on/to/from etc. the person'\nabántu, 'people' → kubántu, 'at/on/to/from etc. the people'\núbabá, 'father' → kúbabá, 'at/on/to/from etc. father'\nṓbabá, 'fathers' → kṓbabá, 'at/on/to/from etc. fathers' (u + o gives o)\nu-Okthoba, 'October' → ku-Okthoba, 'in October'\nFor nouns that are not in class 1 or 2, the locative is formed by replacing the augment of the noun with e-, or with o- with class 11 nouns. For most nouns -ini is also suffixed, which causes various changes to the final vowel of the stem. The additional stem syllable also changes the tone pattern.\n\na + ini → eni\ne + ini → eni\ni + ini → ini\no + ini → weni\nu + ini → wini\nSome examples:\n\nuḿlenze, 'leg' → emlénzeni, 'on the leg'\nîsó, 'eye' → êswéni, 'in the eye'\námánzi, 'water' → émánzini, 'in the water'\níndlebé, 'ear' → éndlebéni, 'in the ear'\nínkungú, 'fog' → énkungwíni, 'in the fog'\nū́phahla, 'roof' → ōpháhleni, 'on the roof'\nSome nouns have locative forms without the suffix, using just the prefix. This includes most nouns for place names, but also a few regular nouns:\n\nîGóli, 'Johannesburg' → êGóli, 'in Johannesburg'\nîndlé, 'the wild' → êndlé, 'in the wild'\nîkhânda, 'head' → êkhânda, 'on the head'\nîkhâya, 'home' → êkhâya, 'at home'\núbusûku, 'night' → ébusûku, 'at night'\nínyákatho, 'north' → ényákatho, 'in the north'"

        "content": "The possessive form is similar to the genitive case of some other languages. It indicates the possessor, or a more general association, and corresponds in meaning to the English preposition \"of\". It is placed after the noun that is possessed, and receives a special possessive prefix that agrees with the preceding noun's class. For example:\n\nū́phahla lwéndlu, 'the roof of the house'\námasôndo êbhási, 'the wheels of the bus'\núkushísa kwoḿlilo, 'the heat of the fire'\nThe possessive prefix is formed from the subject concord of verbs (see the verbs section), plus á. When the possessive prefix is attached to a noun of class 1a (the possessor is class 1a, not the thing possessed), an additional k is infixed, and the subject concord is dropped altogether when it consists of only a vowel.\n\n## Noun classes > ### Possessive > #### Table 3: Zulu possessive prefixes\n\n<pre>```\n| Class   | Prefix   | Prefix + class 1a   |\n|:--------|:---------|:--------------------|\n| 1, 1a   | wá-      | ká-                 |\n| 2, 2a   | bá-      | baká-               |\n| 3       | wá-      | ká-                 |\n| 4       | yá-      | ká-                 |\n| 5       | lá-      | liká-               |\n| 6       | á-       | ká-                 |\n| 7       | sá-      | siká-               |\n| 8       | zá-      | ziká-               |\n| 9       | yá-      | ká-                 |\n| 10      | zá-      | ziká-               |\n| 11      | lwá-     | luká-               |\n| 14      | bá-      | buká-               |\n| 15      | kwá-     | kuká-               |\n| 17      | kwá-     | kuká-               |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe vowel of the prefix coalesces with any initial vowel of the noun, as follows:\n\na + a → a\na + e → e\na + i → e\na + o → o\na + u → o\nFor instance: Isilwane sethu, 'Our animal': formed by sá- (possessive prefix of the class 7 noun isilwane, 'animal') and -íthú (possessive stem of the first person plural personal pronoun).\nWith nouns not in class 1a, the possessive prefix can be attached to either the full form or the simple form of the noun. When attached to the simple form, it has an indefinite meaning, like \"of any\", used with negative verbs. The full form is used in other cases. For example:\n\nangidlánga úkudlá kwênjá, 'I didn't eat the food of the dog' / 'I didn't eat the dog's food'\nangidlánga úkudlá kwânjá, 'I didn't eat the food of any dog' / 'I didn't eat any dog's food'\nWith nouns in class 1a, the prefix, extended with ka, is always attached to the simple form.\nThe possessive form can be extended into a substantive form. It is created by prefixing á-, é- or ó- to the possessive, depending on the noun prefix of the possessed's class: a is used when the possessed noun's prefix begins with a, e when it begins with i, o when it begins with u. In class 6, áw- is prefixed.\n\níndlu yómzingéli, 'the hunter's house' → éyómzingéli, 'the hunter's (one)'\nīkhompyutha likábabá, 'father's computer' → élikábabá, 'father's (one)'"

        "content": "The copulative form of a noun expresses identity, and has a meaning similar to the English copula be. However, it is a noun form rather than a verb, so no verb is needed, at least in the present tense. The copulative is formed by prefixing the so-called \"identifying prefix\", which takes three different forms:\n\nng- if the noun begins with a, e, o or u\ny̤- if the noun begins with i\nw̤- for class 11 nouns\nBy itself, the copulative form means \"it is\" or \"it is a/the\", such as:\n\nngumama, 'it's my mother, it's a/the mother'\ny̤intómbazâne, 'it's a girl'\nw̤ūphâhla lwéndlu, 'it's the roof of the house'\nWhen a noun is equated with something else, the copulative is prefixed with a subject concord (see the verbs section) that matches the subject that the noun is equated with. The subject may or may not be explicitly stated, as usual for verbs. Thus:\n\nínja iy̤isílwane, 'a dog is an animal'\nīkati liy̤isílwane, 'a cat is an animal'\nnginguḿfâzi, 'I am a woman'\nunguḿngani kamama, 'he/she is my mother's friend'\nHowever, when the two things being equated have the same noun class, the subject concord is left out:\n\numúntu ngumúntu ngabántu, 'a person is a person through (other) people'\nThe substantive possessive forms of a noun also have a copulative of their own. They are formed and used in the same way as for the base noun, and always use the prefix ng-.\n\ny̤índlu yómzingéli, 'it's the hunter's house' → ngéyómzingéli, 'it's the hunter's (one)'\ny̤īkhompyutha kábabá, 'it's father's computer' → ngelíkábabá, 'it's father's (one)'\nTo express the negative of the copula, corresponding to English \"is not\" and similar, the prefix a- is added to the subject concord of the existing copulative. The subject concord must therefore always be present; the prefix cannot be added to the bare copulative.\n\nangiy̤isílwane, 'I am not an animal'\nawunguḿngani wámi, 'he/she is not my friend'"

All class forms, including classes 1 and 2, mean \"it\" or \"they\" when referring to a thing of a particular class. For example, yona can refer to inja (class 9), while wona can refer to amanzi (class 6). The class 17 pronoun khona serves as a neutral pronoun, indifferent to class.\nNote that outside of the first- and second-person singular, the possessive stem has an underlying high tone. Since the possessive prefix also has an underlying high tone, the combined high-high tone surfaces as a falling-low pattern, just like in nouns of the HH tone class. In the first- and second-person singular, only the possessive prefix is high-toned, so the resulting surface pattern is simply high-low.\nZulu is a pro-drop language. As the verb already includes prefixes to indicate the subject and object, personal pronouns are not strictly needed, and are mostly used for emphasis."

For classes 4, and 9 the Remote form is usually shortened to the less cumbersome leya as shown for class 9 in the above table.\nThe demonstratives may stand alone, as true pronouns, but may also be used in combination with a noun, much like \"this\" and \"that\" in English. The demonstrative may either precede or follow a noun. If it precedes, the noun appears in the simple form, while if it follows, the noun is in the full form."

In regular Zulu spelling, where vowel length is not marked, this distinction becomes invisible. The three alternative negative past forms are contracted to different degrees. The first form is the uncontracted form.\n\n## Verbs > ### Tenses and moods > #### Subjunctive > ##### Table 23: Examples\n\n<pre>```\n| Verb           | Example                                                         |\n|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| -hámba         | Ngamtshela ahambe. \"I told him he should go.\"                   |\n| -zama          | Woza lapha uzame futhi! \"Come here and try it again!\"           |\n| -hleka         | Umane ahleke. \"He only laughs.\"                                 |\n| -gqoka, -hámba | Wāvuka wagqoka wahamba. \"He woke up, dressed, and went out.\"    |\n| -bheka         | Wābaleka wangabheka emuva. \"He ran away and did not look back.\" |\n```</pre>"
