  Notes:
  - Most French adjectives follow the noun; a subset (the BAGS group) precedes the noun.
  - The feminine form is normally formed by adding -e to the masculine form; this -e is silent.
  - The plural is normally formed by adding -s to the singular (masculine and feminine); this -s is usually mute, but is pronounced [z] in liaison with a following vowel.
  - If the basic form ends in -s, -x, or -z, an adjective is left unchanged in the masculine plural.
  - Some adjectives have irregular feminine forms (e.g., beau → belle, blanc → blanche).
  - Some adjectives have a fifth masculine singular form before a following vowel in liaison contexts (older form; e.g., beau/bel).
  - Some adjectives change position depending on meaning (e.g., ancien means "former" before noun, "ancient" after).
