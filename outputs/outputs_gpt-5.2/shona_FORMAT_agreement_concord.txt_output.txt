      patterns:
      - pattern: "an object marker (Objektsilbe) can be inserted after the subject marker (and any tense marker) and before the verb stem; it generally corresponds to the subject marker series but differs due to its word-internal position"
        examples:
        - "Ti-no-ona munhu uyu."
        - "Ti-no-mu-ona (munhu uyu)."
        notes:

        - u-v

        - u-n
        - u-n
      patterns:
      - pattern: "possessive concord (Besitzsilbe) links a possessed noun to a possessor; its basic form ends in -a, but in combination with nouns it appears with -e"

        - "mwana we-vabereki"
        - "mwana we-ungwaru"

        examples:
        - "bhiza raka-ngwara"
        notes:
        - "Gloss in the source indicates a predicative meaning ('was (and is) clever') used attributively ('the clever horse')."
