      notes:
      - "Chewa nouns are divided into noun classes, conventionally grouped into singular/plural pairs."
      - "Class 11 is not found in Chewa."
      - "Class 14 has no dedicated plural class; class 6 is used."
      - "To form the plural, the plural prefix replaces the singular prefix; exception: ma- is attached directly at the beginning of the word."
      - "Some nouns belong to one class only and do not change between singular and plural."
      - "When class assignment by noun prefix is unclear, concords (e.g., demonstratives) can be used as a guide."

        - "Words like lumo and lusó are treated as class 5/6 and take concords of that class."
        - "In class 5/6, the first consonant is often softened or omitted in the plural."
