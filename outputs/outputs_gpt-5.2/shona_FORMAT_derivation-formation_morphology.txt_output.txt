      patterns:
      - pattern: "ka- (SG) / tu-~ti- (PL) + _stem_"
        notes:
        - "Diminutive formation often uses an additional, relatively consistent noun class: ka- for singular and tu-/ti- for plural."
      - pattern: "Augmentative or diminutive syllable attaches to _stem_ OR to an already existing prefix"
        notes:
        - "Diminutive/augmentative material may be attached either to the noun stem or to an already present class prefix."
      - pattern: "Plural can be marked twice: diminutive/augmentative class prefix pluralized AND regular class prefix pluralized"
        notes:
        - "In some languages, plural formation may be doubled due to both diminutive/augmentative and regular class prefixes being put into the plural."
