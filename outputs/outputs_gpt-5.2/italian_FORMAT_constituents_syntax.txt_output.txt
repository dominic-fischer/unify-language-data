      patterns:
      - pattern: "S V O"
        notes:
        - "Italian is generally an SVO language."
      - pattern: "SVO | SOV | VSO | OVS | etc."
        notes:
        - "Italian has relatively free word order; alternative orders are used especially for emphasis and, in literature, for style and metre."

        - "Davide è arrivato in ufficio."
      - pattern: "(Subject pronoun) V ..."
        notes:

        examples:
        - "È arrivato in ufficio."
        - "(Lui) è arrivato in ufficio."
      - pattern: "Yes/no question: Declarative clause + rising intonation"
        notes:
        - "Questions are formed by rising intonation at the end of the sentence; usually there is no other special marker."
        - "Intonation and context are important to recognize questions from affirmative statements."
        examples:
        - "Davide è arrivato in ufficio?"
        - "È arrivato Davide in ufficio?"
      - pattern: "Wh-question: Wh-word + clause (wh-movement usually occurs)"
