  Features:
    x-Clausetype: [x-main, x-subordinate, x-int-yes-no]
    x-Word-order: [x-V1]
    u-Interrogativity: [u-decl, u-int]
    u-Polarity:
    - u-neg

  Rules:
    x-Clausetype_x-subordinate:
      applies: {x-Clausetype: x-subordinate}
      pattern: "… V … S … (avoid V-final)"
      examples:
      - "Este es el libro que escribió mi amigo."
      note: "In many dependent clauses, the verb is placed before the subject to avoid placing the verb in final position; subject-before-verb is rarer in this context."

    u-Interrogativity_u-decl__x-Clausetype_x-main:
      applies: {x-Clausetype: x-main, u-Interrogativity: u-decl}
      patterns:
      - pattern: "S V O"
        examples:
        - "Mi amigo escribió el libro."
        note: "Unmarked order for affirmative declarative sentences."
      - pattern: "V S O"
        note: "Possible in practice; relatively common compared to other uncommon orders."
      - pattern: "V O S"
        note: "Possible in practice; relatively common compared to other uncommon orders."
      - pattern: "O V S"
        examples:
        - "El libro lo escribió mi amigo."
        note: "Often used when the direct object is the topic/theme and the subject is part of the comment/rheme; object clitic doubling occurs (e.g., 'lo')."
      note: "Word order is variable; topicalization and focus are primary factors. Other orders are very uncommon outside poetry. Subject pronouns are often dropped, so clauses may lack an overt subject."

    u-Interrogativity_u-int__x-Clausetype_x-int-yes-no:
      applies: {x-Clausetype: x-int-yes-no, u-Interrogativity: u-int}
      pattern: "V S O ?"
      examples:
      - "¿Escribió mi amigo el libro?"
      note: "VSO is usual (though not obligatory). Yes/no questions are generally distinguished from declaratives by context and intonation."

    u-Polarity_u-neg__x-Clausetype_x-main:
      applies: {x-Clausetype: x-main, u-Polarity: u-neg}
      patterns:
      - applies: {u-Polarity: u-neg}
        pattern: "CL + V(IMP)"
        note: "In negative commands, the clitic precedes the verb."
      - applies: {u-Polarity: u-pos}
        pattern: "V(IMP) + CL"
        note: "In affirmative imperatives, when clitics are used, the clitic follows the verb."

Syntax:
  Features:
    x-Form-type: [x-clitic]
    u-Valency: [u-imprs]

  Rules:
    u-Valency_u-imprs__x-Form-type_x-clitic:
      applies: {x-Form-type: x-clitic, u-Valency: u-imprs}
      pattern: "se + V(3SG)"
      note: "Impersonal se is described as the only true subject clitic; it does not double and uses only the third-person singular verb form."
