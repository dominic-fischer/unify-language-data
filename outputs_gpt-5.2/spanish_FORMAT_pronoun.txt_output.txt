  Usage:
    Pro-drop:

  Rules:
    x-Pronoun-type_x-pers:
      applies: {x-Pronoun-type: x-pers}
      note: "Personal pronouns vary by grammatical person; Spanish has multiple second-person forms differing by number, formality/social relation, and geographical region."
    u-Case_u-dat:
      applies: {u-Case: u-dat}
      patterns:
      - pattern: "le"
        note: "Preferred (etymological) usage: indirect object function is carried by le regardless of gender."
      - pattern: "la"
        note: "Non-preferred variant: la used as an indirect object (laísmo)."
        examples: ["La dijeron que se callara."]
      - pattern: "lo"
        note: "Non-preferred variant: lo used as an indirect object (loísmo)."
        examples: ["Lo dijeron que se callara."]
      examples: ["Le dijeron que se callara."]
      note: "In the Academy's preferred usage, the person who is told something is an indirect object; le is used for both genders."
    u-Case_u-acc:
      applies: {u-Case: u-acc}
      patterns:
      - pattern: "lo / la"
        note: "Preferred (etymological) usage: direct object function is carried by lo or la according to the gender of the antecedent, regardless of animacy."
      - pattern: "le"
        note: "Condoned by the Academy as a direct object form for masculine, animate antecedents (male humans); otherwise treated as leísmo."
        examples: ["Le miraron."]
      examples: ["lo miraron", "la miraron"]
      note: "Use of le as a direct object outside the condoned context is called leísmo; normative alternatives are lo or la depending on gender."
