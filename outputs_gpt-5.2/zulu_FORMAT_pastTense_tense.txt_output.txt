  Usage:
    zu-recent-past:
      note: 'There are two different past tenses in Zulu: the recent past (also called the perfect) and the remote past. What is ''recent'' versus ''remote'' depends on the speaker. In colloquial language, the recent past is often preferred to the remote past.'
      examples:
      - Sihambile. "We went."
      - Sihambē izolo. "We went yesterday."
    zu-remote-past:
      note: The remote past is used to indicate the distant past, the past preceding the recent past, and as a narrative past.
      examples:
      - Sāhamba. "We went."
  Negation:
    examples:
    - Asihambanga. "We did not go."
    - Asimbonanga. "We have not seen/did not see him/her."
    note: The two past tenses share the same negative forms.
