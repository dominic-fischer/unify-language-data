      patterns:
      - pattern: "Nouns have grammatical gender: masculine or feminine."
        notes:
        - "For nouns referring to humans, grammatical gender usually corresponds to natural gender; often there is a masculine and a feminine noun."
        - "A plural noun referring to both males and females is masculine."
        - "Some nouns have fixed grammatical gender regardless of natural gender (e.g., personne is always feminine; professeur is described as always masculine in standard French, while une professeure is standard in Canadian French and becoming more common in European French)."
        examples:
        - "un chanteur / une chanteuse / une cantatrice"
        - "un catholique / une catholique"
        - "personne (always feminine)"
        - "professeur (described as masculine in standard French); une professeure (Canadian French)"
      - pattern: "Gender is not perfectly predictable from form, but there are trends based on endings."
        notes:
        - "Broad trend: nouns ending in -e tend to be feminine; other nouns tend to be masculine, but exceptions exist."
        - "Endings occurring almost exclusively with feminine nouns: -sion, -tion, -aison, -ité, -logie."
        - "Endings occurring almost exclusively with masculine nouns: -aire, -isme, -ème, -ège."
        - "Many nouns ending in -e preceded by double consonants are also masculine."
        - "Noun clauses are masculine."
        examples:
        - "une étoile; une voiture"
        - "un ballon; un stylo"
        - "un cadre; un arbre; un signe; un meuble"
        - "la peau; une dent"
        - "le coude; un squelette"
      - pattern: "Some nouns can be masculine or feminine with the same meaning; some change gender depending on use; some change meaning depending on gender."
        notes:
        - "A small number of nouns can be either masculine or feminine with the same meaning; often one gender is preferred."
        - "Rarely, nouns change gender by number or by emphatic plural use (e.g., amour, délice; orgue in emphatic plural)."
        - "The plural noun gens is usually masculine but can trigger feminine agreement when certain adjectives precede it."
        - "Some nouns change meaning with gender; gender can also disambiguate homophones."
        examples:
        - "après-midi"
        - "amour (masc sg, fem pl); délice (masc sg, fem pl)"
        - "orgue (masc; fem in emphatic plural: les grandes orgues)"
        - "le critique (critic) / la critique (criticism)"
        - "le livre (book) / la livre (pound)"
        - "le voile (veil) / la voile (sail)"
        - "le pot / la peau (homophonous [po])"
