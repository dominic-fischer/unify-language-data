    u-Number_u-pl__x-Process_x-prefixation:
      applies:
        u-Number: u-pl
        x-Process: x-prefixation
      patterns:
      - pattern: Replace the singular class prefix with the plural class prefix.
        examples:
        - mtu → watu
        - mzizi → mizizi
        - kitu → vitu
        note: Default plural formation switches to the next higher class (odd=singular, even=plural).
      - pattern: For class 11 nouns, plural is class 10.
        examples:
        - ulimi → ndimi
      - pattern: The plural prefix ma- is added directly to the beginning of the word (rather than replacing the singular prefix).
        examples:
        - neno → maneno
      note: Plural formation is generally by switching noun class; class 11 uses class 10; ma- behaves as an exception in prefix attachment.
    u-Animacy_u-anim__x-Domain_x-subject-verb:
      applies:
        u-Animacy: u-anim
        x-Domain: x-subject-verb
      pattern: Animate nouns not in classes 1/2 take class 1/2 agreement prefixes (concords) as if they belonged to class 1/2.
      examples:
      - Kifaru mkubwa alianguka. ↔ Vifaru wakubwa walianguka.
      - Ndege mkubwa alianguka. ↔ Ndege wakubwa walianguka.
      note: Animacy affects concord; nouns referring to people/animals may take 1/2 agreement even when their morphological class is different.
    u-Animacy_u-inan__x-Domain_x-subject-verb:
      applies:
        u-Animacy: u-inan
        x-Domain: x-subject-verb
      pattern: Inanimate nouns take concords of their own noun class.
      examples:
      - Ndege kubwa ilianguka. ↔ Ndege kubwa zilianguka.
      note: Inanimates follow the noun's morphological class for agreement.
    x-Process_x-compounding:
      applies:
        x-Process: x-compounding
      patterns:
      - pattern: 'Compound-like meaning via genitive construction: N1 + GEN(-a) + N2.'
        examples:
        - mpira wa kikapu
      - pattern: 'Compound-like meaning via juxtaposition: N1 + N2.'
        examples:
        - fundi viatu
        - fundi baskeli
        - punda milia / punda-milia / pundamilia
      note: The head noun precedes modifiers; writing of compounds varies (together, hyphenated, or separate).

      applies:
        x-Process: x-suffixation

      pattern: Locative derivation by adding -ni to the noun.
      examples:
      - Wapo barabarani.
      - Watoto wanakwenda shuleni.
      note: To express meanings of locative prepositions, -ni is added to the head noun; omitted with proper names. Locative use is not available for place proper nouns, animate nouns, recent loanwords, and some other nouns.
    u-Number_u-pl__x-Process_x-compounding:
      applies:
        x-Process: x-compounding
        u-Number: u-pl
      pattern: Some compounds have irregular plural forms with number marking on both elements.
      examples:
      - mwanamke → wanawake
      - mwanamume → wanaume
      note: These compounds are formed from mwana plus mke/mume; plural may affect both parts.
