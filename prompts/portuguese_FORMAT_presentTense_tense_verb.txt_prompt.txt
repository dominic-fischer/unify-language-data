SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are an expert in the portuguese language. You excel at inspecting linguistic data from different sources and distilling them into a specific format.

USER PROMPT:
You are a linguist tasked with normalizing grammatical descriptions for the language portuguese.

The data you receive comes from multiple sources and relates to the following topics:
present tense, tense, verb.

Your goal is to transform the data into a structure that EXACTLY matches the reference schema provided.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use ONLY the information present in the provided data.
- Rephrase content where necessary, but do NOT add new facts.
- Merge overlapping information into a single coherent description.
- Ignore information that is not relevant to the reference schema.
- Preserve the hierarchy and ordering of the reference schema.

FEATURES AND THEIR VALUES:
- Feature names and values are prefixed with either u-, x- or pt-.
- Use the prefix "u-" for UniMorph features and values.
- Use the prefix "x-" for custom (non-UniMorph, cross-linguistic) features and values.
- Use the language prefix "portuguese-" ONLY for language-specific features and values.
- When multiple representations are possible, prefer:
  1) UniMorph ("u-") features,
  2) then custom ("x-") features,
  3) and only then language-specific ("portuguese-") features.
- Do NOT invent new features if an appropriate UniMorph feature exists.

SOURCE DATA:

Grammarians usually classify the verbal inflections (i.e. the synthetic verb forms) into the following moods, tenses, and non-finite forms:

indicative mood, used in the main clauses of declarative sentences:
present tense: cantamos, "we sing"
past tenses:
preterite: cantámos (EP), cantamos (BP) "we sang"
imperfect: cantávamos, "we were singing"
pluperfect: cantáramos, "we had sung"
future tense: cantaremos, "we will sing"
conditional mood:
conditional tense: cantaríamos, "we would sing"
subjunctive mood used in certain subordinate clauses:
present subjunctive: que cantemos, "that we sing"
preterite subjunctive: se cantássemos, "if we sang"
future subjunctive: se cantarmos, "if we sing/should we sing"
imperative mood: used to express a command, advice, encouragement, etc.:
positive: canta! "sing!"
negative: não cantes! "don't sing!"
verbals
infinitives:
impersonal: cantar, "to sing"
personal: cantarmos, "for us to sing", "that we sing" or "our singing"
participles:
present participle: cantando "singing"
past (or passive) participle: cantado "sung"
The conditional tense is usually called "future of the past" in Brazilian grammars, whereas in Portugal it is usually classified as a separate "conditional mood". Portuguese grammarians call subjunctive "conjuntivo"; Brazilians call it "subjuntivo".
Note that the synthetic future and conditional have largely disappeared from everyday speech.  The synthetic future is generally replaced by ir + infinitive (e.g. vou cantar "I will sing"), while the conditional is replaced either by the imperfect (especially in its modal use; se você me desse dinheiro, eu cantava "if you gave me money, I would sing") or by the imperfect of ir + infinitive (in its non-modal, "future of the past" usage; ele disse que ia cantar "he said that he would sing").  However, the synthetic future subjunctive is still in common use (e.g. se você for "if you should go").  The synthetic future and conditional of verbs with one-syllable infinitives also sometimes occur (e.g. será/seria "it will/would be" or in the compound tenses terá/teria sido "it will/would have been").
In regular verbs, the personal infinitive is identical to the subjunctive future tense; but they are different in irregular verbs: quando formos ("when we go", subjunctive) versus é melhor irmos ("it is better that we go").
There are also many compound tenses expressed with inflected forms of the auxiliary verbs ser and estar (variants of "to be"), haver and ter (variants of "to have").

Portuguese originally constructed progressive tenses with a conjugated form of the verb "to be", followed by the gerund of the main verb, like English: e.g. Eu estou trabalhando "I am working" (cf. also the corresponding Italian phrase: (Io) sto lavorando). However, in European Portuguese an alternative construction has appeared, formed with the preposition a followed by the infinitive of the main verb: e.g. Eu estou a trabalhar. This has replaced the ancient syntax in central and northern Portugal. The gerund may also be replaced with a followed by the infinitive in less common verb phrases, such as Ele ficou lá, trabalhando / Ele ficou lá, a trabalhar "He stayed there, working". However, the construction with the gerund is still found in southern and insular Portugal and in Portuguese literature, and it is the rule in Brazil.

estou falando or estou a falar ("I am speaking")
estava falando/ a falar (imperfective: "I was speaking" [at the moment])
estive falando/ a falar (perfective: "I was speaking [for a while]" / "I have been speaking" [for a while])
estivera falando/ a falar ("I had been speaking")
estarei falando/ a falar ("I will be speaking")
esteja falando/ a falar ("[that] I/he/she be speaking"; or "am" or "is speaking")
se estivesse falando/ a falar ("if I were speaking")
quando estiver falando/ a falar ("when you are speaking" [in the future])
estar falando/ a falar ("to be speaking")

Tenses with ir + infinitive 

vamos falar ("we will speak", "we are going to speak")
íamos falar ("we were going to speak")
iríamos falar ("we would speak", "we would be going to speak")
In the spoken language, the construction ir + infinitive almost completely replaces the use of the synthetic future (e.g. vamos falar rather than falaremos).
Tenses with multiple auxiliaries:

teríamos estado falando/a falar ("we would have been speaking")
tenho estado falando/a falar ("I have been speaking [until now]")

EXAMPLE OUTPUT (for German):
Present:
  Features:
    u-Person: [u-1, u-2, u-3]
    u-Number: [u-sg, u-pl]
    de-Verbclass: [de-weak, de-strong, de-irregular]
    de-Tense-type: [de-praesens, de-praesens-progressive]

  Negation:
    applies: {x-Negation-type: x-clause}
    note: "Regular negation."
    examples:
    - "Ich weiß nicht."
    - "Er isst den Kuchen nicht."

  Usage:
    de-praesens:
      applies: {u-Aspect: [u-ipfv, u-hab, u-iter]}
      note: "The simple present is the unmarked tense for present reference. It encodes ongoing situations (u-ipfv), habitual actions (u-hab), and repeated or iterative actions (u-iter). It can also be used for near-future reference in context."
      examples:
      - "u-ipfv: Ich lese gerade ein Buch."
      - "u-hab: Er geht jeden Tag zur Arbeit."
      - "u-iter: Er ruft immer wieder an."
    de-praesens-progressive:
      applies: {u-Aspect: [u-prog, u-ipfv]}
      note: "The 'am'-progressive is a colloquial construction used mainly in spoken German. It highlights that an action is ongoing (u-prog), and often overlaps functionally with the simple present as an imperfective marker (u-ipfv). Less common in formal registers."
      examples:
      - "u-prog: Ich bin am Lesen."
      - "u-ipfv: Er ist am Arbeiten."
