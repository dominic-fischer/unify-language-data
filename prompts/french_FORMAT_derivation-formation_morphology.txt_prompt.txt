The schema can be represented as follows:

Title
    Features
        FeatureName1: [value1, value2, ...]
        FeatureName2: [value1, value2, ...]

    Rules
        RuleName
            title?
            notes?
            applies
                feature1: value
                feature2: value
            (patterns | formparadigms | endingparadigms)+

Any combination of patterns, formparadigms and endingparadigms is allowed. This is how they look in detail:

patterns
    - pattern
      title?
      notes?
      examples?

formparadigms
    - title?
      notes?
      examples?
      formparadigm
          - features
            form

endingparadigms
    - title?
      notes?
      examples?
      endingparadigm
          - features
            ending


SCHEMA GUIDELINES:
- Use patterns for pattern-like grammar rules, endings if the paradigm consists of variations in endings, and forms if the paradigm is simply a specific set of forms.- Assign titles to individual patterns if and only if there are multiple patterns under the same rule.
- Assign titles to individual rules if and only if the following is the case:
   - the rule in question is describing a tense
   - the tense encodes more than one aspect
   In that case, the title of the rule is the name by which the tense is commonly known in English.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use ONLY the information present in the provided data.
- Rephrase and reformat content where necessary, but do NOT add new facts.
- Merge overlapping information into a single coherent description in English.
- Preserve the hierarchy and ordering of the reference schema.
- Ignore any information that is not relevant to the topic at hand.

FEATURES AND THEIR VALUES:
- Feature names and values are prefixed with either u- or x-.
- "u-" is for UniMorph features and values, "x-" for custom (non-UniMorph, cross-linguistic) features and values.
- Whenever possible, use UniMorph prefixes.
- Invent new features only if no appropriate UniMorph features exists.
- Do NOT invent new features if an appropriate UniMorph feature exists.

Below are the features for reference:

You are a now tasked with normalizing grammatical descriptions for the language french according to the guidelines outlined above.

The data you receive comes from multiple sources and relates to the following topics:
derivation, formation, morphology.

If possible, select features among the ones below:
	u-Part-of-Speech
		u-adj	(Adjective)
		u-adp	(Adposition)
		u-adv	(Adverb)
		u-art	(Article)
		u-aux	(Auxiliary)
		u-clf	(Classifier)
		u-comp	(Complementizer)
		u-conj	(Conjunction)
		u-det	(Determiner)
		u-intj	(Interjection)
		u-n	(Noun)
		u-num	(Numeral)
		u-part	(Particle)
		u-pro	(Pronoun)
		u-propn	(Proper Name)
		u-v	(Verb)
		u-v.cvb	(Converb)
		u-v.msdr	(Masdar)
		u-v.ptcp	(Participle)
	u-Gender
		u-bantu1-23	(Bantu Noun Classes)
		u-fem	(Feminine)
		u-masc	(Masculine)
		u-nakh1-8	(Nakh-Daghestanian Noun Classes)
		u-neut	(Neuter)

The following may help guide you in your feature selection:
- Use u-Part-of-Speech to distinguish derivational rules that apply to different parts of speech.
- Where necessary, use additional features (e.g., u-Gender) to distinguish subclasses within a part of speech.


SOURCE DATA:
Source 1:
Broadly speaking, there are two types of questions; yes/no questions and information questions.

In French there are four ways to form yes/no questions, each of which is typically associated with a different degree of formality.

The simplest and most informal way to ask a yes/no question is by raising intonation at the end of a declarative sentence. This question formation structure is common in informal spoken French, but relatively uncommon in more formal spoken French or written French. Examples include:

Elle va rester ici ? (Is she going to stay here?)
Je peux mettre mes photos au mur ? (Can I put my photos on the wall?)

Yes/no questions may also be formed by adding est-ce que to the beginning of a declarative sentence. This structure may be used in any style of French; formal, informal, spoken, or written.

Est-ce qu'elle va rester ici ? (Is she going to stay here?)
Est-ce que je peux mettre mes photos au mur ? (Can I put my photos on the wall?)

Source:
This is like adding "is it not?" to the end and it is pronounced [n‿ɛs pɑ].

Tu es Jane, n'est-ce pas ?
Tu parles anglais, n'est-ce pas ?

Finally, yes/no questions may be formed by inverting the verb and the subject. This sentence structure is typically used in formal and written French. These questions may be formed in one of two ways, depending on whether the pronoun is stressed or unstressed. If the pronoun is unstressed, it changes places with the verb that it agrees with.

Es-tu content ? (Are you happy?)
This subject-verb inversion is similar to question formation in English, though in English the inversion may only occur with auxiliary verbs, while in French it may occur with all verbs.
If the subject is anything other than an unstressed pronoun, an unstressed subject pronoun that agrees with the subject is added to the right of the verb.

Pierre est-il content ? (Is Pierre happy?)
Two additional notes on subject verb inversion in French. First, when the inversion results in the adjacency of two vowels ⟨t⟩ is inserted between them.

T-insertion: A-t-il 17 ans ? (Is he 17?)
Secondly, only the most formal French inverts the verb with 'je'. It has become more common, both in spoken and written French, to replace je with est-ce-que. For example, the following two sentences are ungrammatical in French.

*Mens-je ? (Am I lying?)
*Prends-je le bus ? (Am I taking the bus?)

There are four ways to form information questions in French. Like yes/no questions, each form is associated with a different degree of formality.

The simplest and generally most informal way to form an information question in French is by replacing a word in a declarative sentence with a question word or phrase and adding rising intonation to the end of the sentence. The question word or phrase may occur at the beginning or end of the sentence, depending on which word is being replaced, unlike in English, where the question word typically occurs at the start of the sentence.

Declarative sentence – L'étudiant(e) téléphonera à son député demain. (The student will telephone his/her MP tomorrow.)
L'étudiant(e) téléphonera à son député quand ? (When will the student telephone his/her MP?)
Qui téléphonera à son député demain ? (Who will telephone his/her MP tomorrow?)

Another common and informal way of forming information questions is by replacing an item in a declarative sentence by a question word or phrase then moving the question word or phrase to the front of the sentence.

Qui vous avez vu ? (Who did you see?)
À qui Marcel a écrit ? (Who did Marcel write to?)

Another way to form a question in French is by following the steps outlined above in one and two, and in addition inserting est-ce que after the question word. This style of question formation may be used in all styles of French.

Qui est-ce que vous avez vu ? (Who did you see?)
À qui est-ce que Marcel a écrit ? (Who did Marcel write to?)

Finally, information questions in French may be formed by following the steps outlined above in one and two and additionally, inverting the subject and verb. This is typically the most formal form of question formation and is found in written and formal spoken French. As in yes/no question formation, if the subject is an unstressed pronoun, it switches places with the verb:

Qui avez-vous vu ? (Who did you see?)
If the subject is anything other than an unstressed pronoun, an unstressed subject pronoun is added after the verb.

Qui Robert a-t-il rencontré ? (Who did Robert meet?)
