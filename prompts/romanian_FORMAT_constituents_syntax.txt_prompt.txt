SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are an expert in the romanian language. You excel at inspecting linguistic data from different sources and distilling them into a specific format.

USER PROMPT:
You are a linguist tasked with normalizing grammatical descriptions for the language romanian.

The data you receive comes from multiple sources and relates to the following topics:
constituents, syntax.

Your goal is to transform the data into a structure that EXACTLY matches the reference schema provided.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use ONLY the information present in the provided data.
- Rephrase content where necessary, but do NOT add new facts.
- Merge overlapping information into a single coherent description.
- Ignore information that is not relevant to the reference schema.
- Preserve the hierarchy and ordering of the reference schema.

FEATURES AND THEIR VALUES:
- Feature names and values are prefixed with either u-, x- or ro-.
- Use the prefix "u-" for UniMorph features and values.
- Use the prefix "x-" for custom (non-UniMorph, cross-linguistic) features and values.
- Use the language prefix "romanian-" ONLY for language-specific features and values.
- When multiple representations are possible, prefer:
  1) UniMorph ("u-") features,
  2) then custom ("x-") features,
  3) and only then language-specific ("romanian-") features.
- Do NOT invent new features if an appropriate UniMorph feature exists.

Syntactical functions of the adjective can be:

Attribute, in case it defines a noun, pronoun or numeral. (e.g.: The blond boy is here. Băiatul blond este aici.)
Adjectival complement, in case it defines a copulative verb. (e.g.: The boy is blond. Băiatul este blond.)

Romanian has terminology and rules for phrase syntax, which describes the way simple sentences relate to one another within a single complex sentence. There are many functions a simple sentence may take, their number usually being determined by the number of predicates. It is also noteworthy that Romanian terminology for the terms simple sentence, complex sentence, and phrase is somewhat counterintuitive. The Romanian term propoziție means as much as simple sentence (or clause). To describe a complex sentence (or compound sentence), Romanian uses the word frază, which can cause confusion with the English word phrase, which describes not a complex sentence, but a grouping of words. In consequence, Romanian doesn't have terms for the English noun phrase, or verb phrase, preferring the more commonly understood term predicate for the latter. The former has no formal equivalent in Romanian.
Simple sentences can be of two types: main clauses and subordinate clauses

The main clause, within a complex sentence, does not rely on another sentence to be fully understood. In other words, it has stand-alone meaning. The following example has the verb phrase underlined.
Example:

Am văzut copiii din curtea școlii.
I have seen the children in the school courtyard.
Even though this sentence is long, it is still composed of a single simple sentence, which is a main clause.

A subordinate clause cannot have a stand-alone meaning. It relies on a main clause to give it meaning. It usually determines or defines an element of another clause, be it a main clause, or a subordinate one. The following example has the verb phrase underlined, and the element of relation, which is to say, the relative pronoun used to link the two sentences, in bold. The sentences are also separated and numbered.
Example:

Am văzut copiii 1/ care sunt în curtea școlii. 2/
I have seen the children 1/ who are in the school courtyard. 2/
There are also subordinate clauses other than the relative clause, which is an attributive clause, since it determines a noun, pronoun or numeral, and not a verb phrase. Here is a list of examples illustrating some of the remaining cases:
Direct Object Clause (propoziție subordonată completivă directă):

Înțeleg 1/ ce zice profesoara. 2/
I understand 1/ what the teacher is saying. 2/
Indirect Object Clause (propoziție subordonată completivă indirectă):

Mă gândesc 1/ la ce spune profesoara. 2/
I am thinking  1/ about what the teacher is saying. 2/
Subject Clause (propoziție subordonată subiectivă):

Ceea ce zice profesoara, 1/ e corect. 2/
What the teacher is saying, 1/ is true. 2/
Local Circumstantial Object Clause (propoziție subordonată completivă circumstanțială de loc):

Mă văd cu Ionuț 1/ unde (mi-)a propus el. 2/
I am meeting Johnny 1/ where he proposed (to me). 2/

Some conjunctions are called coordinating because they do not define the type of clause introduced. Rather, they coordinate an existing clause with another, making the new clause of the same type as the other one. The coordinating conjunctions are of four types (note that the list is not exhaustive):

The copulative conjunctions are: și (and), nici (neither), and precum și (as well as).
The adversative conjunctions are: dar/însă/ci (but) and iar (on the other hand).
The disjunctive conjunctions are: sau/ori/fie (or/either).
The conclusive conjunctions are: deci/așadar (thus), în concluzie (in conclusion), and prin urmare (therefore).
An example of two main clauses (1, 2) linked together by a coordinative conjunction (bold) is:

Ana este o fată 1/ și Ion este un băiat. 2/
Ana is a girl, 1/ and Ion is a boy. 2/
Two subordinate clauses (2, 3) can also be joined to the same end:

V-am spus despre băiatul 1/ care este la mine în clasă, 2/ și care este foarte bun la matematică. 3/
I have told you about the boy 1/ who is in my class, 2/ and who is very good in mathematics. 3/
The same effect of two main clauses (1, 2) being tied together can also be achieved via juxtaposition of the sentences using a comma:

Am păzit palatul, 1/ palatul era și foarte greu de păzit. 2/
I guarded the palace, 1/ the palace was very hard to guard, too. 2/
