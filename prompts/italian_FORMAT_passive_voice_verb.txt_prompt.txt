INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use ONLY the information present in the provided data.
- Rephrase content where necessary, but do NOT add new facts.
- Merge overlapping information into a single coherent description.
- Ignore information that is not relevant to the reference schema.
- Preserve the hierarchy and ordering of the reference schema.

FEATURES AND THEIR VALUES:
- Feature names and values are prefixed with either u-, x- or it-.
- Use the prefix "u-" for UniMorph features and values.
- Use the prefix "x-" for custom (non-UniMorph, cross-linguistic) features and values.
- Use the language prefix "italian-" ONLY for language-specific features and values.
- When multiple representations are possible, prefer:
  1) UniMorph ("u-") features,
  2) then custom ("x-") features,
  3) and only then language-specific ("italian-") features.
- Do NOT invent new features if an appropriate UniMorph feature exists.

SOURCE DATA:
Source 1:
Based on the ending of their infiniti presenti (-are, -ere, or -ire), all Italian verbs can be assigned to three distinct conjugation patterns. Exceptions are found: fare, 'to do/make' (from Latin fācere), and dire, 'to say' (from Latin dīcere), were originally 2nd conjugation verbs that reduced the unstressed vowel in the infinitive (and consequentially in the future and conditional, whose stem derives from the infinitive), but still follow the 2nd conjugation for all the other tenses; this behaviour is similarly featured in the verbs ending in -trarre, -porre and -durre, derived respectively from the Latin trahere ('to drag'), pōnere ('to put'), and dūcere ('to lead').
Just like many other Romance languages, Italian verbs express distinct verbal aspects by means of analytic structures such as periphrases, rather than synthetic ones; the only aspectual distinction between two synthetic forms is the one between the imperfetto (habitual past tense) and the passato remoto (perfective past tense), although the latter is usually replaced in spoken language by the passato prossimo.

Aspects other than the habitual and the imperfective, such as the perfective, the progressive and the prospective, are rendered in Italian by a series of periphrastic structures that may or may not be perceived as different tenses by different speakers. Note the difference between:

Perfect aspect: io ho fatto ("I have done")
Progressive aspect: io sto facendo ("I'm doing")
Prospective aspect: io sto per fare ("I'm about to do")

Notes

In Italian, compound tenses expressing perfect aspect are formed with either auxiliary verb avere ('to have') for transitive verbs and some intransitive verbs and with essere ('to be') for the remaining intransitive verbs, plus the past participle. Progressive aspect is rendered by verb stare plus the gerund. The prospective aspect is formed with stare plus the preposition per and the infinitive.
The passive voice of transitive verbs is formed with essere in the perfective and prospective aspects, with venire in the progressive or habitual aspect, and with either essere or venire in the perfective aspects:

Il cancello è stato appena aperto. ("The gate has just been opened.")
Il cancello sta per essere aperto ("The gate is about to be opened.")
Il cancello sta venendo aperto in questo momento. ("The gate is being opened right now.")
Il cancello viene aperto ogni giorno. ("The gate is opened every day.")
Il cancello fu/venne aperto in fretta. ("The gate was quickly opened.")
For the perfect tenses of intransitive verbs a reliable rule cannot be given, although a useful rule of thumb is that if a verb's past participle can take on adjectival value, essere is used, otherwise avere. Also, reflexive verbs and unaccusative verbs use essere (typically non-agentive verbs of motion and change of state, i.e. involuntary actions such as cadere ('to fall') or morire ('to die')).
The distinction between the two auxiliary verbs is important for the correct formation of the compound tenses and is essential to the agreement of the past participle. Some verbs, such as vivere ('to live'), may use both: Io ho vissuto ('I have lived') can alternatively be expressed as, Io sono vissuto.

The past participle is used in Italian as both an adjective and to form many of the compound tenses of the language. There are regular endings for the past participle, based on the conjugation class (see below). There are, however, many irregular forms as not all verbs follow the pattern, particularly the -ere verbs. Some of the more common irregular past participles include: essere ('to be') → stato (same for stare); fare ('to do', 'to make') → fatto; dire ('to say, to tell') → detto; aprire ('to open') → aperto; chiedere ('to ask') → chiesto; chiudere ('to close') → chiuso; leggere ('to read') → letto; mettere ('to put') → messo; perdere ('to lose') → perso; prendere ('to take', 'to get') → preso; rispondere ('to answer') → risposto; scrivere ('to write') → scritto; vedere ('to see') → visto.
For the intransitive verbs taking essere, the past participle always agrees with the subject—that is, it follows the usual adjective agreement rules: egli è partito; ella è partita. This is also true for reflexive verbs, the impersonal si construction (which requires any adjectives that refer to it to be in the masculine plural: Si è sempre stanchi alla fine della giornata – One is always tired at the end of the day), and the passive voice, which also use essere (Queste mele sono state comprate da loro – These apples have been bought by them, against Essi hanno comprato queste mele – They bought these apples).
The past participle when used with avere never changes to agree with the subject. It must agree with the object, although, in sentences where this is expressed by a third person clitic pronoun (e.g. Hai mangiato la mela? – Sì, l'ho mangiata (Have you eaten the apple? – Yes, I have eaten it)). When the object is expressed by a first or second person clitic pronoun instead, the agreement is optional: Maria! Ti ha chiamato / chiamata Giovanni? – No, non mi ha chiamato / chiamata (Maria! Has Giovanni called you? – No, he has not).
In all the other cases where the object is not expressed by a clitic pronoun, the agreement with the object is obsolescent in modern Italian (but still correct): La storia che avete raccontata (obsolete) / raccontato non mi convince (The story you told does not convince me); or compare Manzoni's Lucia aveva avute due buone ragioni with the more modern Lucia aveva avuto due buone ragioni (Lucia had had two good reasons).

Italian inherits consecutio temporum, a grammar rule from Latin that governs the relationship between the tenses in principal and subordinate clauses. Consecutio temporum has very rigid rules. These rules require the subjunctive tense in order to express contemporaneity, posteriority and anteriority in relation with the principal clause.

To express contemporaneity when the principal clause is in a simple tense (future, present, or simple past), the subordinate clause uses the present subjunctive, to express contemporaneity in the present.
Penso che Davide sia intelligente. I think David is smart.
When the principal clause has a past imperfect or perfect, the subordinate clause uses the imperfect subjunctive, expressing contemporaneity in the past.
Pensavo che Davide fosse intelligente. I thought David was smart.
To express anteriority when the principal clause is in a simple tense (future, or present or passato prossimo) the subordinate clause uses the past subjunctive.
Penso che Davide sia stato intelligente. I think David has been smart.
To express anteriority when the principal clause has a past imperfect or perfect, the subjunctive has to be pluperfect.
Pensavo che Davide fosse stato intelligente. I thought David had been smart.
To express posteriority the subordinate clause uses the future tense in the indicative mood, not the subjunctive, because the subjunctive has no future tense.
Penso che Davide sarà intelligente. I think David will be smart.
To express posteriority with respect to a past event, the subordinate clause uses the past conditional, whereas in other European languages (such as French, English, and Spanish) the present conditional is used.
Pensavo che Davide sarebbe stato intelligente. I thought that David would have been smart.

The infinitive of first conjugation verbs ends in -are, that of second conjugation verbs in -ere, and that of third conjugation verbs in -ire. In the following examples for different moods, the first conjugation verb is parlare ('to talk/speak'), the second conjugation verb is temere ('to fear') and the third conjugation verb is partire ('to leave/depart').

Many third conjugation verbs insert an infix -sc- between the stem and the endings in the first, second, and third persons singular and third person plural of the present indicative and subjunctive, e.g. capire > capisco, capisci, capisce, capiamo, capite, capiscono (indicative) and capisca, capisca, capisca, capiamo, capiate, capiscano (subjunctive). This subgroup of third conjugation verbs is usually referred to as incoativi, because in Latin the original function of the suffix -sc- was to denote inchoative verbs, but this meaning is totally lost in modern Italian, where the suffix mostly serves a euphonic function.

The Italian subjunctive mood is used to indicate cases of desire, express doubt, make impersonal emotional statements, and to talk about impending events.

Third conjugation verbs, such as capire, mentioned above insert -isc- in the first, second, and third persons singular and third person plural of the present.
Compound forms (past and past perfect) are made by adding the past participle (e.g. parlato) to the corresponding auxiliary form (as abbia) in the present and imperfect.

As the table shows, verbs each take their own root from their class of verb: -are becomes -er-, -ere becomes -er-, and -ire becomes -ir-, the same roots as used in the future indicative tense. All verbs add the same ending to this root.
Some verbs do not follow this pattern, but take irregular roots, these include:
Andare ('to go') ~ Andr-, Avere ('to have') ~ Avr-, Bere ('to drink') ~ Berr-,
Dare ('to give') ~ Dar-, Dovere ('to have to') ~ Dovr-, Essere ('to be') ~ Sar-,
Fare ('to make/do') ~ Far-, Godere ('to enjoy') ~ Godr-, Potere ('to be able to') ~ Potr-,
Rimanere ('to remain') ~ Rimarr-, Sapere ('to know') ~ Sapr-, Sedere ('to sit') ~ Sedr-,
Stare ('to be/feel') ~ Star-, Tenere ('to hold') ~ Terr-, Vedere ('to see') ~ Vedr-,
Venire ('to come') ~ Verr-, Vivere ('to live') ~ Vivr-, Volere ('to want') ~ Vorr- etc.
The Italian conditional mood is a mood that refers to an action that is possible or probable, but is dependent upon a condition. Example:

## Verbs > ### Regular conjugation > #### Conditional mood > ##### Table 31

<pre>```
| 0                                           | 1                                                |
|:--------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| Io andrei in spiaggia, ma fa troppo freddo. | ("I would go to the beach, but it is too cold.") |
```</pre>


It can be used in two tenses, the present, by conjugation of the appropriate verb, or the past, using the auxiliary conjugated in the conditional, with the past participle of the appropriate noun:

## Verbs > ### Regular conjugation > #### Conditional mood > ##### Table 32

<pre>```
| 0                                                                                 | 1                                                                       |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mangerei un sacco adesso, se non stessi cercando di fare colpo su queste ragazze. | ("I would eat a lot now, if I were not trying to impress these girls.") |
| Sarei andato in città, se avessi saputo che ci andavano loro.                     | ("I would have gone to the city, if I had known that they were going.") |
```</pre>


Many Italian speakers often use the imperfect instead of the conditional and subjunctive. Prescriptivists usually view this as incorrect, but it is frequent in colloquial speech and tolerated in all but high registers and in most writing:

## Verbs > ### Regular conjugation > #### Conditional mood > ##### Table 33

<pre>```
| 0                                                                                    | 1                                                                                   |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Se lo sapevo, andavo in spiaggia                                                     | ("If I had known it, I would have gone to the beach.")                              |
| Se Lucia non faceva quel segno, la risposta sarebbe probabilmente stata diversa.[25] | ("If Lucia had not made that sign, the answer would probably have been different.") |
```</pre>


The conditional can also be used in Italian to express "could", with the conjugated forms of potere ('to be able to'), "should", with the conjugated forms of dovere ('to have to'), or "would like", with the conjugated forms of volere ('want'):

## Verbs > ### Regular conjugation > #### Conditional mood > ##### Table 34

|:-----------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| [Lui] potrebbe leggere un libro.         | ("He could read a book.")                  |
| [Loro] dovrebbero andare a letto.        | ("They should go to bed.")                 |
| Vorrei un bicchiere d'acqua, per favore. | ("I would like a glass of water, please.") |

```</pre>


Verbs such as capire insert -isc- in all except the noi and voi forms. Technically, the only real imperative forms are the second-person singular and plural, with the other persons being borrowed from the present subjunctive.

Infinitive: present: -are, -ere, -ire; past: avere/essere + past participle
Gerund: present: -ando, -endo, -endo; past: avendo/essendo + past participle
Participle: present: -ante -ente -ente; past: -ato, -uto (although verbs of the second conjugation almost always have a contracted desinence, e.g. cuocere ('to cook') cotto ('cooked')), -ito

While the majority of Italian verbs are regular, many of the most commonly used are irregular. In particular, the auxiliary verbs essere, stare and avere, and the common modal verbs dovere (expressing necessity or obligation), potere (expressing permission and to a lesser degree ability), sapere (expressing ability) and volere (expressing willingness) are all irregular.
The only irregular verbs of the first conjugation are dare ('to give'), which follows the same pattern as stare, and andare ('to go'), which features suppletive forms in the present of the indicative, subjunctive and imperative from the Latin verb VADERE. While apparently a 1st conjugation verb, fare is actually a highly irregular verb of the second conjugation. Even the third conjugation features a small handful of irregular verbs, such as morire ('to die'), whose present is muoio, muori, muore, moriamo, morite, muoiono (indicative) and muoia, muoia, muoia, moriamo, moriate, muoiano (subjunctive).
The second conjugation combines the second and third conjugation of Latin; since the verbs belonging to the third conjugation were athematic, and they behaved less regularly than the ones belonging to the other conjugations (compare AMĀRE > AMAVI, AMATVS, first conjugation, and LEGĚRE > LEGI, LECTVS, third conjugation), the second conjugation Italian features many irregularities that trace back to the original paradigms of the Latin verbs: amare > amai, amato (first conjugation, regular), but leggere > lessi, letto (second conjugation, irregular).
