INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use ONLY the information present in the provided data.
- Rephrase content where necessary, but do NOT add new facts.
- Merge overlapping information into a single coherent description.
- Ignore information that is not relevant to the reference schema.
- Preserve the hierarchy and ordering of the reference schema.

FEATURES AND THEIR VALUES:
- Feature names and values are prefixed with either u-, x- or zu-.
- Use the prefix "u-" for UniMorph features and values.
- Use the prefix "x-" for custom (non-UniMorph, cross-linguistic) features and values.
- Use the language prefix "zulu-" ONLY for language-specific features and values.
- When multiple representations are possible, prefer:
  1) UniMorph ("u-") features,
  2) then custom ("x-") features,
  3) and only then language-specific ("zulu-") features.
- Do NOT invent new features if an appropriate UniMorph feature exists.

SOURCE DATA:

Um ein Verb ins Passiv zu setzen, wird ein «-w-» vor das Schluss-a gesetzt (siehe unter Verbmodifikatoren

Nachsilben). Das Wörtchen «von» (z.B. ich wurde von ihm gefragt.) wird durch -ng- (vor a-/e-/o-/u-)  bzw. -y- (vor -i) gekennzeichnet.

Source 2:
Like nouns, verbs are formed by adding prefixes to a basic stem. However, the prefixes are not a fixed part of the verb, but indicate subject, object and various other nuances. Different stems and prefixes are used to indicate different tenses and moods. Normally, verbs are cited in the stem of the principal present tense, which ends in -a, for example -wa "to fall", -dlá "to eat", -enza "to do, to make", -bôna "to see", -síza "to help", -sebénza "to work". A few verbs end in other vowels, namely -âzi "to know", -sho "to say", -thi "to say".
Prefixes are always attached in a fixed order; the object prefix always comes last, immediately before the verb stem, while the subject prefix comes before the object prefix. Certain tense, mood and polarity prefixes may intervene between the subject and object prefix, or be placed before the subject prefix. No prefix may come between the object prefix and the stem. For example, wālipheka "he/she cooked it" consists of a stem -pheka "to cook", preceded in reverse order by an object prefix li- (class 5), the remote past tense marker -ā-, and the subject prefix u- (he/she/class 1, which becomes w- when a vowel follows). The form angikuboni "I don't see you" consists of a stem -boni (the negative stem of -bona "to see"), prefixed by the object prefix ku- (second-person singular), the subject prefix ngi- (first-person singular), and the negative marker a-.

Both the subject and, when applicable, the object of the verb are indicated by prefixes or concords attached to the verb stem. Zulu is a pro-drop language: explicit personal pronouns are only used for emphasis, while in general the concords on the verb give enough information. When a noun is used as the subject or object, then the concord must match its class. To refer to someone in the third-person, without a noun, classes 1 and 2 are used. The subject concord must always be present, except in the infinitive and imperative forms. The object concord is always optional, even when an explicit object follows the verb.
Four different kinds of verbal concord exist. For the subject, there are the primary subject, secondary subject and participial subject concords. In addition, a separate set is used for the object. The four are essentially the same if not for tone, except in class 1.

The primary subject concords (subj1) are used for the subject in all tenses of the positive indicative mood. They are underlyingly low-toned in the first and second person, and high-toned in the remainder.
Secondary subject concords (subj2) are used for the subject on all verbs marked with negation and on verbs marked for the subjunctive mood. They are all underlyingly high-toned.
The participial subject concords (subjP) are present whenever its verb is in participial form. This concord extant on participial verbs is used regardless of the verb's tense. They are identical to the secondary subject concords, except that any final a becomes e.
The object concords (obj) are used for the object of the verb, and are only used for transitive verbs and can be used to mark specificity and/or definiteness. They are all underlyingly high-toned.
The letters in parentheses indicate additional letters that are added when the prefix is not at the start of the word, functioning to "save" the phonology from being violated or to avoid ambiguity.

```</pre>


Examples:

Sihamba manje., 'We are going now.'
Thina sihamba manje., 'We are going now.' (with emphasis)
Ngiyambona., 'I see him/her.'
Ngimbona yena., 'I see him/her.' (with emphasis)
Ngimnika isipho., 'I give him/her a gift.'
The reflexive prefix only occurs as an object, and refers back to the subject of the sentence. It is equivalent to English forms like myself, yourself, himself and so on.

ngiyazigeza, 'I wash myself'
uyazibona, 'he sees himself'

The participial form is used, among others:

to indicate simultaneity
in subordinate clauses with certain conjunctions.
with certain auxiliary verbs.

The infinitive is an action noun, and belongs to class 15, which is reserved specifically for infinitives. It is a noun in every respect, and therefore it has a simple form, locative, possessive and so on. It corresponds to the English to-infinitive or gerund.

## Verbs > ### Tenses and moods > #### Infinitive > ##### Table 10: Formation of the infinitive

| 0           | 1               |
|:------------|:----------------|
| Affirmative | úku[obj]...a    |
| Negative    | úkunga[obj]...i |
```</pre>


With passive verbs ending in -(i)wa, the suffix -a is used in the negative instead of the normal -i.

## Verbs > ### Tenses and moods > #### Infinitive > ##### Table 11: Examples

<pre>```
| Verb   | Affirmative infinitive              | Negative infinitive                        |
|:-------|:------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| -wa    | ukúwa "to fall; falling"            | ukúngawí "to not fall"                     |
| -dlá   | úkudlá "to eat, eating"             | ukúngadlí "to not eat"                     |
| -dlá   | ukuyídla "to eat it" (class 4 or 9) | ukúngayîdli "to not eat it" (class 4 or 9) |
| -bôna  | úkubôna "to see"                    | ukúngabôni "to not see"                    |
| -bôna  | ukúngibôna "to see me"              | ukúngangíbôni "to not see me"              |
| -enza  | ukwénza "to do"                     | ukúngenzí "to not do"                      |
| -osa   | ukósa "to roast"                    | ukúngosí "to not roast"                    |
```</pre>


The infinitive may also sometimes be a result noun or other noun associated with the verb. For example, while the infinitive ukudla in its regular meaning is "to eat", it also has the lexical meaning of "food". This differs per verb and is a lexical property of that particular infinitive form, and must therefore be learned for each one.

The imperative is used to issue direct commands. It can occur either alone or with an object prefix.

## Verbs > ### Tenses and moods > #### Imperative > ##### Table 12: Formation of the imperative

<pre>```
| 0        | 1          | 2           |
|:---------|:-----------|:------------|
| nan      | Alone      | With object |
| Singular | (yi)...a   | [obj]...e   |
| Plural   | (yi)...ani | [obj]...eni |
```</pre>


The plural form, with the suffix -ni, is used when addressing multiple people.
The prefix yi- is used when the verb stem has only one syllable. A shortened form y- is used when the stem begins with a vowel (regardless of number of syllables). Exceptionally, the verb -za "to come" uses the prefix wo- instead, thus woza, wozani etc.

## Verbs > ### Tenses and moods > #### Imperative > ##### Table 13: Examples

<pre>```
| Verb   | Alone                  | With object                                 |
|:-------|:-----------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| -dlá   | Yidlá! Yidláni! "Eat!" | Yídle! Yidleni! "Eat it!" (class 4 or 9)    |
| -enza  | Yenzá! Yenzáni! "Do!"  | Kwenze! Kwenzeni! "Do it!" (class 15 or 17) |
| -síza  | Síza! Sizáni! "Help!"  | Ngisize! Ngisizeni! "Help me!"              |
```</pre>

The present tense is the default tense, used to indicate events in the present. It corresponds to the English simple present or continuous present.

## Verbs > ### Tenses and moods > #### Present tense > ##### Table 14: Formation of the present tense

<pre>```
| 0           | 1                    | 2                   |

| Negative    | a[subj2][obj]...i    | [subjP]nga[obj]...i |

The infix -ya- is used whenever the form has lengthening on the penultimate syllable, i.e. when it occurs finally in the sentence.

There are two different past tenses in Zulu, the recent past (also called the perfect) and the remote past (or preterite). They both share the same negative forms, however. What is "recent" versus "remote" depends on the speaker. The remote past is used to indicate the distant past, the past preceding the recent past, and as a narrative past. In the colloquial language, the recent past is often preferred to the remote past.

| Negative    | Negative | a[subj2][obj]...anga | [subjP]nga[obj]...anga |
```</pre>


The long form in -ile is found when the verb has a lengthened penultimate syllable (same as the present -ya-), otherwise the short form in -ē is used.

| Verb   | Example                                              |
|:-------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| -hámba | Sihambile. "We went."                                |
| -hámba | Sāhamba. "We went."                                  |
| -hámba | Sihambē izolo. "We went yesterday."                  |
| -hámba | Asihambanga. "We did not go."                        |
| -bôna  | Asimbonanga. "We have not seen/did not see him/her." |
```</pre>


With verbs of certain endings, the recent past ending -ile is not used, and instead the vowels of the last two syllables of the stem are changed. There is no distinction between long and short forms (-ile vs -ē) in these verbs.

## Verbs > ### Tenses and moods > #### Past tense > ##### Table 18

<pre>```
| Ending in     | Recent past ending   |
|:--------------|:---------------------|
| -ala, -ela    | -ele                 |
| -ama, -ema    | -eme                 |
| -ana, -ena    | -ene                 |
| -asa, -esa    | -ese                 |

| -awa1         | -ewe                 |
```</pre>


1 This is a unique case, namely the irregular passive -bulawa from -bulala.

There are two different future tenses in Zulu, the immediate future and distant future. They are essentially identical in form, with z in the immediate future versus y in the remote future.

<pre>```
| 0           | 1         | 2                       | 3                         |
|:------------|:----------|:------------------------|:--------------------------|

| Affirmative | Immediate | [subj1]zo(ku)[obj]...a  | [subjP]zo(ku)[obj]...a    |
| Affirmative | Distant   | [subj1]yo(ku)[obj]...a  | [subjP]yo(ku)[obj]...a    |

| Negative    | Distant   | a[subj2]yu(ku)[obj]...a | [subjP]ngeyu(ku)[obj]...a |
```</pre>


Both originate as periphrastic forms, from the auxiliary verbs -za "to come" and -ya "to go" respectively, followed by an infinitive. These two have fused into one word in modern Zulu, but remnants of their former status as two distinct words remain in various respects. The following list shows the approximate way in which the contraction of the immediate future preceded, using the verb -síza "to help" as an example.

## Verbs > ### Tenses and moods > #### Future tense > ##### Table 20: Origin of the immediate future

<pre>```
| Affirmative   | Negative       | Contraction level                                                         |
|:--------------|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ngiza ukusiza | angizi ukusiza | 1. Original periphrastic form.                                            |
| ngizokusiza   | angiziyukusiza | 2. Two words fused into one.                                              |
| nan           | angizukusiza   | 3. Glide -y- deleted.                                                     |
| ngizosiza     | angizusiza     | 4. -ku- infix of the infinitive deleted.                                  |
| ngōsiza       | angūsiza       | 5. -z-/-y- of the auxiliary deleted, contraction of subject prefix vowel. |
```</pre>


Generally, the forms of contraction levels 4 or 5 are used. With monosyllabic verbs, or verbs beginning with vowels, contraction only proceeds to level 3 so that the -ku- remains. Note that in the most contracted form, the distinction between immediate and distant future entirely disappears.

The subjunctive expresses hypothetical situations, wishes and requests. It is also used for consecutive action, and as a complement to certain auxiliary verbs and conjunctions. There are present and past subjunctive forms.

## Verbs > ### Tenses and moods > #### Subjunctive > ##### Table 22: Formation of the subjunctive

<pre>```
| 0           | 1                   | 2                                                             |
|:------------|:--------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|
| nan         | Present             | Past                                                          |
| Affirmative | [subj2][obj]...e    | [subj1]a[obj]...a                                             |
| Negative    | [subj2]nga[obj]...i | a[subj1]anga[obj]...a [subj1]anga[obj]...a a[subj1]a[obj]...a |
```</pre>


Note that the affirmative past subjunctive is identical to the affirmative remote past, except that the infix -a- is short. In regular Zulu spelling, where vowel length is not marked, this distinction becomes invisible. The three alternative negative past forms are contracted to different degrees. The first form is the uncontracted form.

A range of Zulu verbs indicate a change of state or a process, which tends towards some final goal (cf. inchoative verbs). From these, a special kind of verb called a stative verb can be formed, which describes being in the state of having completed that process, i.e. "to be (state)". Stative verbs often fulfill the function that an adjective has in English. For example, the English adjective hungry translates to -lambile "be hungry", a stative verb.

## Verbs > ### Stative verbs > #### Table 24: Formation of stative verbs

<pre>```
| 0           | 1              |
|:------------|:---------------|
| Affirmative | [subj1]...ile  |
| Negative    | a[subj1]...ile |
```</pre>


Stative verbs are formed similarly to the recent past, but with a few differences: there is a separate negative form, there is no shorter form ending in -ē, and no participial form. However, like the recent past tense, a stative verb can be formed by changing the vowels of the last two vowels of the stem, depending on the ending of the verb.
A stative verb is not a fully functional verb, as it can only be inflected in the present tense and infinitive. To form the past and future tenses of stative verbs, the auxiliary -bē is used, either alone for the past tense, or with future tense inflections.

## Verbs > ### Stative verbs > #### Table 25: Examples

<pre>```
| Base verb   | Non-stative                         | Stative                                 |
|:------------|:------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| -fá         | Uyafa. "He is dying."               | Ufile. "He is dead."                    |
| -lamba      | Ngiyalamba. "I am becoming hungry." | Ngilambile. "I am hungry."              |
| -búya       | Siyabuya. "We are turning back."    | Sibuyile. "We have returned."           |
| -lála       | Bayalala. "They sleep."             | Balele. "They are asleep."              |
| -lála       | Balalile. "They slept."             | Babē balele. "They were asleep."        |
| -lála       | Bazolala. "They will sleep."        | Bazokubē balele. "They will be asleep." |
```</pre>

New verbs are readily created from simple verbs by attaching various suffixes to the stem, to get different shades of meaning. The following table lists these suffixes, and an example using the base verb -enza "to do, to make":

| Type                                                                     | Suffix               | Example                               |

| Reciprocal: each other                                                   | -ana                 | -thandana "to love each other"        |
| Neuter-passive: be -able                                                 | -eka                 | -fundeka "to be readable"             |

| Causative: cause/make                                                    | -isa                 | -fundisa "to teach”                   |
| Intensive: intense/quick action                                          | -isisa               | -fundisisa "to study/read well/quick" |
| Passive: be -ed                                                          | -(i)wa               | -fundwa "to be read/studied"          |
| Reduplication: repetitive, for a little bit, or it doesn’t happen easily | reduplicate the verb | -fundafunda “to study/read for a bit” |
```</pre>


For reduplication, verb roots that are more than two syllables long only have the first two syllables reduplicated. For example, the word “cabanga” when reduplicated is “cabacabanga” and not “cabangacabanga.”

The imperfect functions similarly to that of English. It expresses continuous events, such as “I was walking.” There is no difference between perfect and imperfect aspects in the present tense.
