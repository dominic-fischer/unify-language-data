SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are an expert in the chewa language. You excel at inspecting linguistic data from different sources and distilling them into a specific format.

USER PROMPT:
You are a linguist tasked with normalizing grammatical descriptions for the language chewa.

The data you receive comes from multiple sources and relates to the following topics:
present tense, tense.

Your goal is to transform the data into a structure that EXACTLY matches the reference schema provided.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use ONLY the information present in the provided data.
- Rephrase content where necessary, but do NOT add new facts.
- Merge overlapping information into a single coherent description.
- Make sure to ignore information that is not relevant to the topic(s) in question: present tense, tense.
- Preserve the hierarchy and ordering of the reference schema.

FEATURES AND THEIR VALUES:
- Feature names and values are prefixed with either u-, x- or ny-.
- Use the prefix "u-" for UniMorph features and values.
- Use the prefix "x-" for custom (non-UniMorph, cross-linguistic) features and values.
- Use the language prefix "chewa-" ONLY for language-specific features and values.
- When multiple representations are possible, prefer:
  1) UniMorph ("u-") features,
  2) then custom ("x-") features,
  3) and only then language-specific ("chewa-") features.
- Do NOT invent new features if an appropriate UniMorph feature exists.

The same concords w- (derived from u-) and a-, combined with the vowel a, make the subject prefix of the perfect tense. In the plural the two prefixes a-a- combine into a single vowel:

mwaná wapita 'the child has gone; aná apita 'the children have gone'

Tenses in Chichewa are differentiated in two ways, by their tense-marker (or tense-infix), and by their tonal pattern. Sometimes two tenses have the same tense-marker and differ in their tonal pattern alone. In the following examples, the tense-marker is underlined:

ndi-ku-gúla 'I am buying'
ndí-ma-gúla 'I usually buy'
ndi-ma-gúla 'I was buying', 'I used to buy'
ndí-dzá-gula 'I will buy (tomorrow or in future)'
ndí-ká-gula 'I will buy (when I get there)'
One tense has no tense-marker:

ndí-gula 'I will buy (soon)'
Tenses can be modified further by adding certain other infixes, called 'aspect-markers', after the tense-marker. These are -má- 'always, usually' -ká- 'go and', -dzá 'come and' or 'in future', and -ngo- 'only', 'just'. These infixes can also be used on their own, as tense-markers in their own right (compare the use of -ma- and -dza- in the list of tenses above). For example:

ndi-ku-má-gúlá 'I am always buying'
ndi-ná-ká-gula 'I went and bought'
ndí-má-ngo-gúla 'I just usually buy'
Compound tenses, such as the following, are also found in Chichewa:

nd-a-khala ndí-kú-gúla 'I have been buying'

Chewa has a large number of tenses, some of which differ in some respects from the tenses met with in European languages. The distinction between one tense and another is made partly by the use of infixes, such as -na- and -ku-, and partly by the intonation of the verb, since each tense has its own particular tonal pattern.

There are five time-frames (remote past, near past, present, near future, and remote future). The distinction between near and remote tenses is not exact. The remote tenses are not used of events of today or last night, but the near tenses can sometimes be used of events of earlier or later than today:

ndi-ná-gula 'I bought (yesterday or some days ago)' (remote perfect)
nd-a-gula 'I have bought (today)' (perfect)
ndi-ku-gúla 'I am buying (now)' (present)
ndí-gula 'I'll buy (today)' (near future)
ndi-dzá-gula 'I'll buy (tomorrow or later)' (remote future)

Another distinction is between perfect and past. The two perfect tenses imply that the event described had an outcome which still obtains now. The two past tenses usually imply that the result of the action has been reversed in some way:
Recent time (today):

nd-a-gula 'I have bought it' (and still have it) (Perfect)
ndi-na-gúla 'I bought it (but no longer have it)' (Recent Past)
Remote time (yesterday or earlier):

ndi-ná-gula or ndi-dá-gula 'I bought it' (and still have it) (Remote Perfect)
ndí-ná-a-gúla or ndí-dá-a-gúla 'I bought it (but no longer have it)' (Remote Past)
When used in narrating a series of events, however, these implications are somewhat relaxed: the Remote Perfect is used for narrating earlier events, and the Recent Past for narrating events of today.

Another important distinction in Chewa is between perfective and imperfective aspect. Imperfective tenses are used for situations, events which occur regularly, or events which are temporarily in progress:

ndi-nká-gúlá 'I used to buy', 'I was buying (a long time ago)'
ndi-ma-gúla 'I was buying (today)', 'I used to buy (a long time ago)'
ndí-zi-dza-gúla 'I will be buying (regularly)'
In the present tense only, there is a further distinction between habitual and progressive:

ndí-ma-gúla 'I buy (regularly)'
ndi-ku-gúla 'I am buying (currently)'

One future tense not found in European languages is the -ká- future, which 'might presuppose an unspoken conditional clause':

ndí-ká-gula 'I will buy' (if I go there, or when I get there)
There are also various subjunctive and potential mood tenses, such as:

ndi-gulé 'I should buy'
ndi-zí-gúlá 'I should be buying'
ndi-dzá-gúlé 'I should buy (in future)'
ndi-nga-gule 'I can buy'
ndi-kadá-gula 'I would have bought'

Negative tenses, if they are main verbs, are made with the prefix sí-. They differ in intonation from the positive tenses. The negative of the -ná- tense has the ending -e instead of -a:

sí-ndí-gula 'I don't buy'
sí-ndi-na-gúle 'I didn't buy'
Tenses which mean 'will not' or 'have not yet' have a single tone on the penultimate syllable:

si-ndi-dza-gúla 'I won't buy'
si-ndi-na-gúle 'I haven't bought (it) yet'
Infinitives, participial verbs, and the subjunctive make their negative with -sa-, which is added after the subject-prefix instead of before it. They similarly have a single tone on the penultimate syllable:

ndi-sa-gúle 'I should not buy'
ku-sa-gúla 'not to buy'

The tenses used in certain kinds of dependent clauses (such as relative clauses and some types of temporal clauses) differ from those used in main clauses. Dependent verbs often have a tone on the first syllable. Sometimes this change of tone alone is sufficient to show that the verb is being used in a dependent clause. Compare for example:

a-ku-gúla 'he is buying'
á-kú-gúla 'when he is buying' or 'who is buying'
Other commonly used dependent tenses are the following:

ndí-tá-gúla 'after I bought/buy'
ndí-sa-na-gúle 'before I bought/buy'
There is also a series of tenses using a toneless -ka- meaning 'when' of 'if', for example:

ndi-ka-gula 'when/if I buy'
ndi-ka-dzá-gula 'if in future I buy'
ndi-ka-má-gúlá 'whenever I buy'
ndí-ka-da-gúla 'if I had bought'

EXAMPLE OUTPUT (for German):
Present:
  Features:
    u-Person: [u-1, u-2, u-3]
    u-Number: [u-sg, u-pl]
    de-Verbclass: [de-weak, de-strong, de-irregular]
    de-Tense-type: [de-praesens, de-praesens-progressive]

  Negation:
    applies: {x-Negation-type: x-clause}
    note: "Regular negation."
    examples:
    - "Ich weiß nicht."
    - "Er isst den Kuchen nicht."

  Usage:
    de-praesens:
      applies: {u-Aspect: [u-ipfv, u-hab, u-iter]}
      note: "The simple present is the unmarked tense for present reference. It encodes ongoing situations (u-ipfv), habitual actions (u-hab), and repeated or iterative actions (u-iter). It can also be used for near-future reference in context."
      examples:
      - "u-ipfv: Ich lese gerade ein Buch."
      - "u-hab: Er geht jeden Tag zur Arbeit."
      - "u-iter: Er ruft immer wieder an."
    de-praesens-progressive:
      applies: {u-Aspect: [u-prog, u-ipfv]}
      note: "The 'am'-progressive is a colloquial construction used mainly in spoken German. It highlights that an action is ongoing (u-prog), and often overlaps functionally with the simple present as an imperfective marker (u-ipfv). Less common in formal registers."
      examples:
      - "u-prog: Ich bin am Lesen."
      - "u-ipfv: Er ist am Arbeiten."
