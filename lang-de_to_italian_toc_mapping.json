        "content": "Nouns have gender (masculine, feminine or, in many instances, both) and inflect in number (singular and plural). When a noun refers to people or animals with natural gender, grammatical gender typically corresponds. The gender each noun is written in is not arbitrary: because most nouns have a masculine and a feminine form, the form the given noun is written in could change the entire structure of the sentence. As in most other Romance languages, the historical neuter has merged with the masculine. A subgroup of these deriving from Latin's second declension are considered feminine in the plural. Subclauses and infinitives are masculine. Adjectives inflect for gender and number in patterns broadly similar to nouns.\n\n## Inflection of nouns and adjectives > ### Table 5: General noun and adjectival endings by number and gender\n\n<pre>```\n| Gender                                 | Singular          | Plural            | Example                                                                                |\n|:---------------------------------------|:------------------|:------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Masculine                              | -o                | -i                | il cappello nero, i cappelli neri ('the black hat(s)')                                 |\n| Feminine                               | -a                | -e                | la bella macchina, le belle macchine ('the beautiful car(s)')                          |\n| Masculine and feminine                 | -e                | -i                | il/la comandante intelligente, i/le comandanti intelligenti ('the smart commander(s)') |\n| Mixed (historically neuter)            | -o                | -a                | il lenzuolo leggero, le lenzuola leggere ('the light bed sheet(s)')                    |\n| Masculine                              | -a                | -i                | l'atleta entusiasta, gli atleti entusiasti ('the enthusiastic athlete(s)')             |\n| Feminine                               | -ie               | -ie               | la specie estinta, le specie estinte ('the extinct species')                           |\n| All nouns ending with a stressed vowel | singular = plural | singular = plural | la città, le città ('the city(-ies)')                                                  |\n| Non-integrated loanwords               | singular = plural | singular = plural | il/la manager trendy, i/le manager trendy ('the trendy manager(s)')                    |\n```</pre>\n\n\nIn the last two examples, only the article carries information about gender and number.\nMost masculine words that end in -io pronounced as /jo/ drop the -o and thus end in -i in the plural: vecchio / vecchi ('old'), funzionario / funzionari ('functionary(-ies)'), esempio / esempi ('example(s)'), etc.\nThe Italian hard and soft C and G phenomenon leads to certain peculiarities in spelling and pronunciation:\n\nWords in -cio and -gio form plurals in -ci and -gi, e.g. bacio / baci ('kiss(es)')\nWords in -cia and -gia have been a point of contention. According to a commonly employed rule, they:\nform plurals in -ce and -ge if the final letter before the suffix is a consonant: frangia, frange ('fringe(s)'); faccia, facce ('face(s)').\nform plurals in -cie and -gie if the final letter before the suffix is a vowel: camicia, camicie ('shirt(s)'); ciliegia, ciliegie ('cherry'/'cherries'). Note that the presence of an i in the plural ending has no impact on the pronunciation in this case.\nwhen the i is stressed, it always remains in plural: farmacia / farmacie ('chemist's shop(s)'), nevralgia / nevralgie ('neuralgia(s)').\nWords in -co and -go behave irregularly: for some words the plural form causes the hard consonant to become soft, and for others the consonant remains hard. \"The grammarians are skeptical of any attempt at giving a ruling about this area.\" There are, however, certain rules of thumb:\nplurals are formed with -chi and -ghi if the last letter before the suffix is a consonant or a stressed vowel: fungo / funghi ('mushroom(s)'), stecco / stecchi ('stick(s)'), mago / maghi ('magician(s)'), fuoco / fuochi ('fire(s)')\nplurals are formed with -ci and -gi if the last letter before the suffix is an unstressed vowel: comico / comici ('comedian(s)'), medico / medici ('physician(s)')\nin words ending with -logo suffix, the plural is usually in -gi when -logo means 'expert' or 'student', corresponding to English -logist (e.g. archeologo / archeologi, 'archaeologist(s)'), while it is in -ghi when it means 'speech' or 'reasoning', corresponding often to English -logue/-log (e.g. catalogo / cataloghi, 'catalogue(s)').\nthere are exceptions such as amico / amici ('friend(s)'), greco / greci ('Greek(s)'), valico / valichi ('mountain pass(es)'), carico / carichi ('cargo(s)').\nWords in -ca and -ga form plurals in -che and -ghe, e.g. amica / amiche ('female friend(s)')"

If the two letters before the last vowel are pr or br (e.g. aspro, celebre), the r is removed and -errimo is the suffix used (asperrimo, celeberrimo) ('very sour', 'very famous'). Another way to form the absolute superlative is to place either molto or assai ('very') before the adjective. For instance sporchissimo and molto sporco ('very dirty') are the same, although the form ending in issimo is usually perceived as more emphatic; that is, sporchissimo is dirtier than molto sporco.\nSome adjectives have irregular comparatives (although with regularly-formed variants also in common use), such as\n\nbuono ('good'), migliore / più buono ('better' or 'best'), ottimo / buonissimo ('very good')\ncattivo ('bad'), peggiore / più cattivo ('worse' or 'worst'), pessimo / cattivissimo ('very bad')\ngrande ('big'), maggiore / più grande ('bigger'), massimo / grandissimo ('very big')\npiccolo ('small'), minore / più piccolo ('smaller'), minimo / piccolissimo ('very small')"

In general, intonation and context are important to recognize questions from affirmative statements.\n\n## Syntax > ### Table 45\n\n<pre>```\n| 0                                    | 1                                                                                                                                  |\n|:-------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Davide è arrivato in ufficio.        | (\"David has arrived at the office.\")                                                                                               |\n| Davide è arrivato in ufficio?        | (\"Talking about David… did he arrive at the office?\" or \"Davide has arrived at the office?

But: as with French, adjectives coming before the noun indicate essential quality of the noun. Demonstratives (e.g. questo, 'this', quello, 'that') come before the noun, and a few particular adjectives (e.g. bello) may be inflected like demonstratives and placed before the noun."

All verbs add the same ending to this root.\nSome verbs do not follow this pattern, but take irregular roots, these include:\nAndare ('to go') ~ Andr-, Avere ('to have') ~ Avr-, Bere ('to drink') ~ Berr-,\nDare ('to give') ~ Dar-, Dovere ('to have to') ~ Dovr-, Essere ('to be') ~ Sar-,\nFare ('to make/do') ~ Far-, Godere ('to enjoy') ~ Godr-, Potere ('to be able to') ~ Potr-,\nRimanere ('to remain') ~ Rimarr-, Sapere ('to know') ~ Sapr-, Sedere ('to sit') ~ Sedr-,\nStare ('to be/feel') ~ Star-, Tenere ('to hold') ~ Terr-, Vedere ('to see') ~ Vedr-,\nVenire ('to come') ~ Verr-, Vivere ('to live') ~ Vivr-, Volere ('to want') ~ Vorr- etc.\nThe Italian conditional mood is a mood that refers to an action that is possible or probable, but is dependent upon a condition. Example:\n\n## Verbs > ### Regular conjugation > #### Conditional mood > ##### Table 31\n\n<pre>```\n| 0                                           | 1                                                |\n|:--------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|\n| Io andrei in spiaggia, ma fa troppo freddo. | (\"I would go to the beach, but it is too cold.\") |\n```</pre>\n\n\nIt can be used in two tenses, the present, by conjugation of the appropriate verb, or the past, using the auxiliary conjugated in the conditional, with the past participle of the appropriate noun:\n\n## Verbs > ### Regular conjugation > #### Conditional mood > ##### Table 32\n\n<pre>```\n| 0                                                                                 | 1                                                                       |\n|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mangerei un sacco adesso, se non stessi cercando di fare colpo su queste ragazze. | (\"I would eat a lot now, if I were not trying to impress these girls.\") |\n| Sarei andato in città, se avessi saputo che ci andavano loro.                     | (\"I would have gone to the city, if I had known that they were going.\") |\n```</pre>\n\n\nMany Italian speakers often use the imperfect instead of the conditional and subjunctive. Prescriptivists usually view this as incorrect, but it is frequent in colloquial speech and tolerated in all but high registers and in most writing:\n\n## Verbs > ### Regular conjugation > #### Conditional mood > ##### Table 33\n\n<pre>```\n| 0                                                                                    | 1                                                                                   |\n|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Se lo sapevo, andavo in spiaggia                                                     | (\"If I had known it, I would have gone to the beach.\")                              |\n| Se Lucia non faceva quel segno, la risposta sarebbe probabilmente stata diversa.[25] | (\"If Lucia had not made that sign, the answer would probably have been different.\") |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe conditional can also be used in Italian to express \"could\", with the conjugated forms of potere ('to be able to'), \"should\", with the conjugated forms of dovere ('to have to'), or \"would like\", with the conjugated forms of volere ('want'):\n\n## Verbs > ### Regular conjugation > #### Conditional mood > ##### Table 34\n\n<pre>```\n| 0                                        | 1                                          |\n|:-----------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|\n| [Lui] potrebbe leggere un libro.         | (\"He could read a book.\")                  |\n| [Loro] dovrebbero andare a letto.        | (\"They should go to bed.\")                 |\n| Vorrei un bicchiere d'acqua, per favore. | (\"I would like a glass of water, please.\") |\n```</pre>"

        "content": "In Italian, compound tenses expressing perfect aspect are formed with either auxiliary verb avere ('to have') for transitive verbs and some intransitive verbs and with essere ('to be') for the remaining intransitive verbs, plus the past participle. Progressive aspect is rendered by verb stare plus the gerund. The prospective aspect is formed with stare plus the preposition per and the infinitive.\nThe passive voice of transitive verbs is formed with essere in the perfective and prospective aspects, with venire in the progressive or habitual aspect, and with either essere or venire in the perfective aspects:\n\nIl cancello è stato appena aperto. (\"The gate has just been opened.\")\nIl cancello sta per essere aperto (\"The gate is about to be opened.\")\nIl cancello sta venendo aperto in questo momento. (\"The gate is being opened right now.\")\nIl cancello viene aperto ogni giorno. (\"The gate is opened every day.\")\nIl cancello fu/venne aperto in fretta. (\"The gate was quickly opened.\")\nFor the perfect tenses of intransitive verbs a reliable rule cannot be given, although a useful rule of thumb is that if a verb's past participle can take on adjectival value, essere is used, otherwise avere. Also, reflexive verbs and unaccusative verbs use essere (typically non-agentive verbs of motion and change of state, i.e. involuntary actions such as cadere ('to fall') or morire ('to die')).\nThe distinction between the two auxiliary verbs is important for the correct formation of the compound tenses and is essential to the agreement of the past participle. Some verbs, such as vivere ('to live'), may use both: Io ho vissuto ('I have lived') can alternatively be expressed as, Io sono vissuto."

Nevertheless, the SVO sequence is sometimes replaced by one of the other arrangements (SOV, VSO, OVS, etc.), especially for reasons of emphasis and, in literature, for reasons of style and metre: Italian has relatively free word order.\nThe subject is usually omitted when it is a pronoun—distinctive verb conjugations make it redundant. Subject pronouns are considered emphatic when used at all.\nQuestions are formed by a rising intonation at the end of the sentence (in written form, a question mark).

When a noun refers to people or animals with natural gender, grammatical gender typically corresponds. The gender each noun is written in is not arbitrary: because most nouns have a masculine and a feminine form, the form the given noun is written in could change the entire structure of the sentence. As in most other Romance languages, the historical neuter has merged with the masculine. A subgroup of these deriving from Latin's second declension are considered feminine in the plural.

According to a commonly employed rule, they:\nform plurals in -ce and -ge if the final letter before the suffix is a consonant: frangia, frange ('fringe(s)'); faccia, facce ('face(s)').\nform plurals in -cie and -gie if the final letter before the suffix is a vowel: camicia, camicie ('shirt(s)'); ciliegia, ciliegie ('cherry'/'cherries'). Note that the presence of an i in the plural ending has no impact on the pronunciation in this case.\nwhen the i is stressed, it always remains in plural: farmacia / farmacie ('chemist's shop(s)'), nevralgia / nevralgie ('neuralgia(s)').\nWords in -co and -go behave irregularly: for some words the plural form causes the hard consonant to become soft, and for others the consonant remains hard. \"The grammarians are skeptical of any attempt at giving a ruling about this area.\" There are, however, certain rules of thumb:\nplurals are formed with -chi and -ghi if the last letter before the suffix is a consonant or a stressed vowel: fungo / funghi ('mushroom(s)'), stecco / stecchi ('stick(s)'), mago / maghi ('magician(s)'), fuoco / fuochi ('fire(s)')\nplurals are formed with -ci and -gi if the last letter before the suffix is an unstressed vowel: comico / comici ('comedian(s)'), medico / medici ('physician(s)')\nin words ending with -logo suffix, the plural is usually in -gi when -logo means 'expert' or 'student', corresponding to English -logist (e.g. archeologo / archeologi, 'archaeologist(s)'), while it is in -ghi when it means 'speech' or 'reasoning', corresponding often to English -logue/-log (e.g. catalogo / cataloghi, 'catalogue(s)').\nthere are exceptions such as amico / amici ('friend(s)'), greco / greci ('Greek(s)'), valico / valichi ('mountain pass(es)'), carico / carichi ('cargo(s)').\nWords in -ca and -ga form plurals in -che and -ghe, e.g. amica / amiche ('female friend(s)')"

The choice of plural is sometimes left to the user, while in some cases there are differences of meaning:\n\nSometimes, for body parts, the feminine/neuter plural denotes the literal meaning while the masculine one denotes a figurative meaning: il braccio ('the arm') / le braccia ('the arms') / i bracci ('the isthmuses', 'the inlets'); il corno ('the horn') / le corna ('the horns' of an animal) / i corni ('the horns' as musical instruments)\nSometimes, especially in poetic and old-fashioned Italian, the masculine plural acts as a count noun, while the neuter/feminine plural acts as a mass noun: il cervello ('the brain') / due cervelli ('two brains') / le cervella ('the cerebral matter'); l'anello ('the ring') / due anelli ('two rings') / le anella ('ringlets'); furthermore, il dito ('the finger') / le dita ('the fingers') and also due dita ('two fingers') / but i diti indici ('the index fingers')\nMost noun stems are derived from the accusative: Latin socer/socerum begets Italian suocero, and Latin pēs/pēdem begets Italian piede. There are a few exceptions, however, such as uomo from Latin homo/hominem and moglie from Latin mulier/mulierem. Neuter third-declension nouns may bequeath Italian nouns either from the nominative/accusative case (e.g. capo from caput, cuore from cor) or from the oblique case used for other cases and for the plural (e.g. latte from lac, lact-, giure from ius, iur-)."

Exceptions are found: fare, 'to do/make' (from Latin fācere), and dire, 'to say' (from Latin dīcere), were originally 2nd conjugation verbs that reduced the unstressed vowel in the infinitive (and consequentially in the future and conditional, whose stem derives from the infinitive), but still follow the 2nd conjugation for all the other tenses; this behaviour is similarly featured in the verbs ending in -trarre, -porre and -durre, derived respectively from the Latin trahere ('to drag'), pōnere ('to put'), and dūcere ('to lead').\nJust like many other Romance languages, Italian verbs express distinct verbal aspects by means of analytic structures such as periphrases, rather than synthetic ones; the only aspectual distinction between two synthetic forms is the one between the imperfetto (habitual past tense) and the passato remoto (perfective past tense), although the latter is usually replaced in spoken language by the passato prossimo."

        "content": "In Italian, compound tenses expressing perfect aspect are formed with either auxiliary verb avere ('to have') for transitive verbs and some intransitive verbs and with essere ('to be') for the remaining intransitive verbs, plus the past participle. Progressive aspect is rendered by verb stare plus the gerund. The prospective aspect is formed with stare plus the preposition per and the infinitive.\nThe passive voice of transitive verbs is formed with essere in the perfective and prospective aspects, with venire in the progressive or habitual aspect, and with either essere or venire in the perfective aspects:\n\nIl cancello è stato appena aperto. (\"The gate has just been opened.\")\nIl cancello sta per essere aperto (\"The gate is about to be opened.\")\nIl cancello sta venendo aperto in questo momento. (\"The gate is being opened right now.\")\nIl cancello viene aperto ogni giorno. (\"The gate is opened every day.\")\nIl cancello fu/venne aperto in fretta. (\"The gate was quickly opened.\")\nFor the perfect tenses of intransitive verbs a reliable rule cannot be given, although a useful rule of thumb is that if a verb's past participle can take on adjectival value, essere is used, otherwise avere. Also, reflexive verbs and unaccusative verbs use essere (typically non-agentive verbs of motion and change of state, i.e. involuntary actions such as cadere ('to fall') or morire ('to die')).\nThe distinction between the two auxiliary verbs is important for the correct formation of the compound tenses and is essential to the agreement of the past participle. Some verbs, such as vivere ('to live'), may use both: Io ho vissuto ('I have lived') can alternatively be expressed as, Io sono vissuto."

        "similarity": 1.0,
        "content": "The past participle is used in Italian as both an adjective and to form many of the compound tenses of the language. There are regular endings for the past participle, based on the conjugation class (see below). There are, however, many irregular forms as not all verbs follow the pattern, particularly the -ere verbs. Some of the more common irregular past participles include: essere ('to be') → stato (same for stare); fare ('to do', 'to make') → fatto; dire ('to say, to tell') → detto; aprire ('to open') → aperto; chiedere ('to ask') → chiesto; chiudere ('to close') → chiuso; leggere ('to read') → letto; mettere ('to put') → messo; perdere ('to lose') → perso; prendere ('to take', 'to get') → preso; rispondere ('to answer') → risposto; scrivere ('to write') → scritto; vedere ('to see') → visto.\nFor the intransitive verbs taking essere, the past participle always agrees with the subject—that is, it follows the usual adjective agreement rules: egli è partito; ella è partita. This is also true for reflexive verbs, the impersonal si construction (which requires any adjectives that refer to it to be in the masculine plural: Si è sempre stanchi alla fine della giornata – One is always tired at the end of the day), and the passive voice, which also use essere (Queste mele sono state comprate da loro – These apples have been bought by them, against Essi hanno comprato queste mele – They bought these apples).\nThe past participle when used with avere never changes to agree with the subject. It must agree with the object, although, in sentences where this is expressed by a third person clitic pronoun (e.g. Hai mangiato la mela? – Sì, l'ho mangiata (Have you eaten the apple? – Yes, I have eaten it)). When the object is expressed by a first or second person clitic pronoun instead, the agreement is optional: Maria! Ti ha chiamato / chiamata Giovanni? – No, non mi ha chiamato / chiamata (Maria! Has Giovanni called you? – No, he has not).\nIn all the other cases where the object is not expressed by a clitic pronoun, the agreement with the object is obsolescent in modern Italian (but still correct): La storia che avete raccontata (obsolete) / raccontato non mi convince (The story you told does not convince me); or compare Manzoni's Lucia aveva avute due buone ragioni with the more modern Lucia aveva avuto due buone ragioni (Lucia had had two good reasons)."

I think David is smart.\nWhen the principal clause has a past imperfect or perfect, the subordinate clause uses the imperfect subjunctive, expressing contemporaneity in the past.\nPensavo che Davide fosse intelligente.

This subgroup of third conjugation verbs is usually referred to as incoativi, because in Latin the original function of the suffix -sc- was to denote inchoative verbs, but this meaning is totally lost in modern Italian, where the suffix mostly serves a euphonic function."

All verbs add the same ending to this root.\nSome verbs do not follow this pattern, but take irregular roots, these include:\nAndare ('to go') ~ Andr-, Avere ('to have') ~ Avr-, Bere ('to drink') ~ Berr-,\nDare ('to give') ~ Dar-, Dovere ('to have to') ~ Dovr-, Essere ('to be') ~ Sar-,\nFare ('to make/do') ~ Far-, Godere ('to enjoy') ~ Godr-, Potere ('to be able to') ~ Potr-,\nRimanere ('to remain') ~ Rimarr-, Sapere ('to know') ~ Sapr-, Sedere ('to sit') ~ Sedr-,\nStare ('to be/feel') ~ Star-, Tenere ('to hold') ~ Terr-, Vedere ('to see') ~ Vedr-,\nVenire ('to come') ~ Verr-, Vivere ('to live') ~ Vivr-, Volere ('to want') ~ Vorr- etc.\nThe Italian conditional mood is a mood that refers to an action that is possible or probable, but is dependent upon a condition. Example:\n\n## Verbs > ### Regular conjugation > #### Conditional mood > ##### Table 31\n\n<pre>```\n| 0                                           | 1                                                |\n|:--------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|\n| Io andrei in spiaggia, ma fa troppo freddo. | (\"I would go to the beach, but it is too cold.\") |\n```</pre>\n\n\nIt can be used in two tenses, the present, by conjugation of the appropriate verb, or the past, using the auxiliary conjugated in the conditional, with the past participle of the appropriate noun:\n\n## Verbs > ### Regular conjugation > #### Conditional mood > ##### Table 32\n\n<pre>```\n| 0                                                                                 | 1                                                                       |\n|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mangerei un sacco adesso, se non stessi cercando di fare colpo su queste ragazze. | (\"I would eat a lot now, if I were not trying to impress these girls.\") |\n| Sarei andato in città, se avessi saputo che ci andavano loro.                     | (\"I would have gone to the city, if I had known that they were going.\") |\n```</pre>\n\n\nMany Italian speakers often use the imperfect instead of the conditional and subjunctive. Prescriptivists usually view this as incorrect, but it is frequent in colloquial speech and tolerated in all but high registers and in most writing:\n\n## Verbs > ### Regular conjugation > #### Conditional mood > ##### Table 33\n\n<pre>```\n| 0                                                                                    | 1                                                                                   |\n|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Se lo sapevo, andavo in spiaggia                                                     | (\"If I had known it, I would have gone to the beach.\")                              |\n| Se Lucia non faceva quel segno, la risposta sarebbe probabilmente stata diversa.[25] | (\"If Lucia had not made that sign, the answer would probably have been different.\") |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe conditional can also be used in Italian to express \"could\", with the conjugated forms of potere ('to be able to'), \"should\", with the conjugated forms of dovere ('to have to'), or \"would like\", with the conjugated forms of volere ('want'):\n\n## Verbs > ### Regular conjugation > #### Conditional mood > ##### Table 34\n\n<pre>```\n| 0                                        | 1                                          |\n|:-----------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|\n| [Lui] potrebbe leggere un libro.         | (\"He could read a book.\")                  |\n| [Loro] dovrebbero andare a letto.        | (\"They should go to bed.\")                 |\n| Vorrei un bicchiere d'acqua, per favore. | (\"I would like a glass of water, please.\") |\n```</pre>"

        "content": "While the majority of Italian verbs are regular, many of the most commonly used are irregular. In particular, the auxiliary verbs essere, stare and avere, and the common modal verbs dovere (expressing necessity or obligation), potere (expressing permission and to a lesser degree ability), sapere (expressing ability) and volere (expressing willingness) are all irregular.\nThe only irregular verbs of the first conjugation are dare ('to give'), which follows the same pattern as stare, and andare ('to go'), which features suppletive forms in the present of the indicative, subjunctive and imperative from the Latin verb VADERE. While apparently a 1st conjugation verb, fare is actually a highly irregular verb of the second conjugation. Even the third conjugation features a small handful of irregular verbs, such as morire ('to die'), whose present is muoio, muori, muore, moriamo, morite, muoiono (indicative) and muoia, muoia, muoia, moriamo, moriate, muoiano (subjunctive).\nThe second conjugation combines the second and third conjugation of Latin; since the verbs belonging to the third conjugation were athematic, and they behaved less regularly than the ones belonging to the other conjugations (compare AMĀRE > AMAVI, AMATVS, first conjugation, and LEGĚRE > LEGI, LECTVS, third conjugation), the second conjugation Italian features many irregularities that trace back to the original paradigms of the Latin verbs: amare > amai, amato (first conjugation, regular), but leggere > lessi, letto (second conjugation, irregular).\n\n## Verbs > ### Irregular verbs > #### Table 36: essere(to be;

        "content": "In Italian, compound tenses expressing perfect aspect are formed with either auxiliary verb avere ('to have') for transitive verbs and some intransitive verbs and with essere ('to be') for the remaining intransitive verbs, plus the past participle. Progressive aspect is rendered by verb stare plus the gerund. The prospective aspect is formed with stare plus the preposition per and the infinitive.\nThe passive voice of transitive verbs is formed with essere in the perfective and prospective aspects, with venire in the progressive or habitual aspect, and with either essere or venire in the perfective aspects:\n\nIl cancello è stato appena aperto. (\"The gate has just been opened.\")\nIl cancello sta per essere aperto (\"The gate is about to be opened.\")\nIl cancello sta venendo aperto in questo momento. (\"The gate is being opened right now.\")\nIl cancello viene aperto ogni giorno. (\"The gate is opened every day.\")\nIl cancello fu/venne aperto in fretta. (\"The gate was quickly opened.\")\nFor the perfect tenses of intransitive verbs a reliable rule cannot be given, although a useful rule of thumb is that if a verb's past participle can take on adjectival value, essere is used, otherwise avere. Also, reflexive verbs and unaccusative verbs use essere (typically non-agentive verbs of motion and change of state, i.e. involuntary actions such as cadere ('to fall') or morire ('to die')).\nThe distinction between the two auxiliary verbs is important for the correct formation of the compound tenses and is essential to the agreement of the past participle. Some verbs, such as vivere ('to live'), may use both: Io ho vissuto ('I have lived') can alternatively be expressed as, Io sono vissuto."

        "content": "Italian inherits consecutio temporum, a grammar rule from Latin that governs the relationship between the tenses in principal and subordinate clauses. Consecutio temporum has very rigid rules. These rules require the subjunctive tense in order to express contemporaneity, posteriority and anteriority in relation with the principal clause.\n\nTo express contemporaneity when the principal clause is in a simple tense (future, present, or simple past), the subordinate clause uses the present subjunctive, to express contemporaneity in the present.\nPenso che Davide sia intelligente. I think David is smart.\nWhen the principal clause has a past imperfect or perfect, the subordinate clause uses the imperfect subjunctive, expressing contemporaneity in the past.\nPensavo che Davide fosse intelligente. I thought David was smart.\nTo express anteriority when the principal clause is in a simple tense (future, or present or passato prossimo) the subordinate clause uses the past subjunctive.\nPenso che Davide sia stato intelligente. I think David has been smart.\nTo express anteriority when the principal clause has a past imperfect or perfect, the subjunctive has to be pluperfect.\nPensavo che Davide fosse stato intelligente. I thought David had been smart.\nTo express posteriority the subordinate clause uses the future tense in the indicative mood, not the subjunctive, because the subjunctive has no future tense.\nPenso che Davide sarà intelligente. I think David will be smart.\nTo express posteriority with respect to a past event, the subordinate clause uses the past conditional, whereas in other European languages (such as French, English, and Spanish) the present conditional is used.\nPensavo che Davide sarebbe stato intelligente. I thought that David would have been smart."

        "content": "In Italian, compound tenses expressing perfect aspect are formed with either auxiliary verb avere ('to have') for transitive verbs and some intransitive verbs and with essere ('to be') for the remaining intransitive verbs, plus the past participle. Progressive aspect is rendered by verb stare plus the gerund. The prospective aspect is formed with stare plus the preposition per and the infinitive.\nThe passive voice of transitive verbs is formed with essere in the perfective and prospective aspects, with venire in the progressive or habitual aspect, and with either essere or venire in the perfective aspects:\n\nIl cancello è stato appena aperto. (\"The gate has just been opened.\")\nIl cancello sta per essere aperto (\"The gate is about to be opened.\")\nIl cancello sta venendo aperto in questo momento. (\"The gate is being opened right now.\")\nIl cancello viene aperto ogni giorno. (\"The gate is opened every day.\")\nIl cancello fu/venne aperto in fretta. (\"The gate was quickly opened.\")\nFor the perfect tenses of intransitive verbs a reliable rule cannot be given, although a useful rule of thumb is that if a verb's past participle can take on adjectival value, essere is used, otherwise avere. Also, reflexive verbs and unaccusative verbs use essere (typically non-agentive verbs of motion and change of state, i.e. involuntary actions such as cadere ('to fall') or morire ('to die')).\nThe distinction between the two auxiliary verbs is important for the correct formation of the compound tenses and is essential to the agreement of the past participle. Some verbs, such as vivere ('to live'), may use both: Io ho vissuto ('I have lived') can alternatively be expressed as, Io sono vissuto."

        "content": "Italian inherits consecutio temporum, a grammar rule from Latin that governs the relationship between the tenses in principal and subordinate clauses. Consecutio temporum has very rigid rules. These rules require the subjunctive tense in order to express contemporaneity, posteriority and anteriority in relation with the principal clause.\n\nTo express contemporaneity when the principal clause is in a simple tense (future, present, or simple past), the subordinate clause uses the present subjunctive, to express contemporaneity in the present.\nPenso che Davide sia intelligente. I think David is smart.\nWhen the principal clause has a past imperfect or perfect, the subordinate clause uses the imperfect subjunctive, expressing contemporaneity in the past.\nPensavo che Davide fosse intelligente. I thought David was smart.\nTo express anteriority when the principal clause is in a simple tense (future, or present or passato prossimo) the subordinate clause uses the past subjunctive.\nPenso che Davide sia stato intelligente. I think David has been smart.\nTo express anteriority when the principal clause has a past imperfect or perfect, the subjunctive has to be pluperfect.\nPensavo che Davide fosse stato intelligente. I thought David had been smart.\nTo express posteriority the subordinate clause uses the future tense in the indicative mood, not the subjunctive, because the subjunctive has no future tense.\nPenso che Davide sarà intelligente. I think David will be smart.\nTo express posteriority with respect to a past event, the subordinate clause uses the past conditional, whereas in other European languages (such as French, English, and Spanish) the present conditional is used.\nPensavo che Davide sarebbe stato intelligente. I thought that David would have been smart."

        "content": "Italian features a sizeable set of pronouns. Personal pronouns are inflected for person, number, case, and, in the third person, gender. Literary subject pronouns also have a distinction between animate (egli, ella) and inanimate (esso, essa) antecedents, although this is lost in colloquial usage, where lui, lei, and loro are the most used forms for animate subjects, while no specific pronoun is employed for inanimate subjects (if needed, demonstrative pronouns such as questo or quello may be used). There is also the uninflected pronoun ciò, which is only used with abstract antecedents.\nPersonal pronouns are normally omitted in the subject, as the conjugation is usually enough to determine the grammatical person. They are used when some emphasis is needed, e.g. sono italiano ('I am Italian') vs. io sono italiano ('I [specifically, as opposed to others] am Italian').\nThe words ci, vi and ne act both as personal pronouns (respectively instrumental and genitive case) and clitic pro-forms for \"there\" (ci and vi, with identical meaning—as in c'è, ci sono, v'è, vi sono, ci vengo, etc.) and \"from there\" (ne—as in: è entrato in casa alle 10:00 e ne è uscito alle 11:00).\n\n## Pronouns > ### Table 15: Personal pronouns\n\n<pre>```\n| 0   | 1   | 2     | 3                                  | 4

        "content": "Although objects come after the verb as a rule, this is often not the case with a class of unstressed clitic pro-forms.\nClitic pronouns are replaced with the stressed form for emphatic reasons. A somewhat similar situation is represented by the dative shift in English ditransitive verbs. Compare, for example, (emphasis in italic) \"John gave a book to her\" with \"John gave her a book\". In Italian these two different emphases map respectively to \"John diede un libro a lei\" (stressed form) and \"John le diede un libro\" (clitic form). Compared to English, Italian presents a richer set of cases.\nClitic pronouns generally come before the verb, but in certain types of constructions, such as lo devo fare, they can also appear as enclitics (attached to the verb itself)—in this case, devo farlo. In the infinitive, gerund and, except with third-person courtesy forms, imperative moods clitic pronouns must always be compound to the suffix as enclitics (as in confessalo! [2p. sg.]/confessiamolo! [1p. pl.]/confessatelo!

        "content": "Italian makes use of the T–V distinction in second-person address. The second-person nominative pronoun is tu for informal use, and for formal use, the third-person form Lei (and historically Ella) has been used since the Renaissance. It is used like Sie in German, usted in Spanish, and vous in French. Lei was originally an object form of ella, which in turn referred to an honorific of the feminine gender such as la magnificenza tua/vostra ('Your Magnificence') or Vossignoria ('Your Lordship'), and by analogy, Loro came to be used as the formal plural. Previously, and in some Italian regions today (e.g. Campania), voi was used as the formal singular, like French vous. The pronouns lei (third-person singular), Lei (formal second-person singular), loro (third-person plural), and Loro (formal second-person plural) are pronounced the same but written as shown, and formal Lei and Loro take third-person conjugations. Formal Lei is invariable for gender (always feminine), but adjectives that modify it are not: one would say to a man La conosco ('I know you') but Lei è alto ('You are tall'). Formal Loro is variable for gender: Li conosco ('I know you [masc. pl.]') vs. Le conosco ('I know you [fem. pl.]'), etc. The formal plural is very rarely used in modern Italian; the unmarked form is widely used instead. For example: Gino, Lei è un bravo ingegnere. Marco, Lei è un bravo architetto. Insieme, voi sarete una gran bella squadra. (\"Gino, you are a good engineer. Marco, you are a good architect. Together, you will make a very good team.\")."

Exceptions are found: fare, 'to do/make' (from Latin fācere), and dire, 'to say' (from Latin dīcere), were originally 2nd conjugation verbs that reduced the unstressed vowel in the infinitive (and consequentially in the future and conditional, whose stem derives from the infinitive), but still follow the 2nd conjugation for all the other tenses; this behaviour is similarly featured in the verbs ending in -trarre, -porre and -durre, derived respectively from the Latin trahere ('to drag'), pōnere ('to put'), and dūcere ('to lead').\nJust like many other Romance languages, Italian verbs express distinct verbal aspects by means of analytic structures such as periphrases, rather than synthetic ones; the only aspectual distinction between two synthetic forms is the one between the imperfetto (habitual past tense) and the passato remoto (perfective past tense), although the latter is usually replaced in spoken language by the passato prossimo."

        "content": "In Italian, compound tenses expressing perfect aspect are formed with either auxiliary verb avere ('to have') for transitive verbs and some intransitive verbs and with essere ('to be') for the remaining intransitive verbs, plus the past participle. Progressive aspect is rendered by verb stare plus the gerund. The prospective aspect is formed with stare plus the preposition per and the infinitive.\nThe passive voice of transitive verbs is formed with essere in the perfective and prospective aspects, with venire in the progressive or habitual aspect, and with either essere or venire in the perfective aspects:\n\nIl cancello è stato appena aperto. (\"The gate has just been opened.\")\nIl cancello sta per essere aperto (\"The gate is about to be opened.\")\nIl cancello sta venendo aperto in questo momento. (\"The gate is being opened right now.\")\nIl cancello viene aperto ogni giorno. (\"The gate is opened every day.\")\nIl cancello fu/venne aperto in fretta. (\"The gate was quickly opened.\")\nFor the perfect tenses of intransitive verbs a reliable rule cannot be given, although a useful rule of thumb is that if a verb's past participle can take on adjectival value, essere is used, otherwise avere. Also, reflexive verbs and unaccusative verbs use essere (typically non-agentive verbs of motion and change of state, i.e. involuntary actions such as cadere ('to fall') or morire ('to die')).\nThe distinction between the two auxiliary verbs is important for the correct formation of the compound tenses and is essential to the agreement of the past participle. Some verbs, such as vivere ('to live'), may use both: Io ho vissuto ('I have lived') can alternatively be expressed as, Io sono vissuto."

        "similarity": 1.0,
        "content": "The past participle is used in Italian as both an adjective and to form many of the compound tenses of the language. There are regular endings for the past participle, based on the conjugation class (see below). There are, however, many irregular forms as not all verbs follow the pattern, particularly the -ere verbs. Some of the more common irregular past participles include: essere ('to be') → stato (same for stare); fare ('to do', 'to make') → fatto; dire ('to say, to tell') → detto; aprire ('to open') → aperto; chiedere ('to ask') → chiesto; chiudere ('to close') → chiuso; leggere ('to read') → letto; mettere ('to put') → messo; perdere ('to lose') → perso; prendere ('to take', 'to get') → preso; rispondere ('to answer') → risposto; scrivere ('to write') → scritto; vedere ('to see') → visto.\nFor the intransitive verbs taking essere, the past participle always agrees with the subject—that is, it follows the usual adjective agreement rules: egli è partito; ella è partita. This is also true for reflexive verbs, the impersonal si construction (which requires any adjectives that refer to it to be in the masculine plural: Si è sempre stanchi alla fine della giornata – One is always tired at the end of the day), and the passive voice, which also use essere (Queste mele sono state comprate da loro – These apples have been bought by them, against Essi hanno comprato queste mele – They bought these apples).\nThe past participle when used with avere never changes to agree with the subject. It must agree with the object, although, in sentences where this is expressed by a third person clitic pronoun (e.g. Hai mangiato la mela? – Sì, l'ho mangiata (Have you eaten the apple? – Yes, I have eaten it)). When the object is expressed by a first or second person clitic pronoun instead, the agreement is optional: Maria! Ti ha chiamato / chiamata Giovanni? – No, non mi ha chiamato / chiamata (Maria! Has Giovanni called you? – No, he has not).\nIn all the other cases where the object is not expressed by a clitic pronoun, the agreement with the object is obsolescent in modern Italian (but still correct): La storia che avete raccontata (obsolete) / raccontato non mi convince (The story you told does not convince me); or compare Manzoni's Lucia aveva avute due buone ragioni with the more modern Lucia aveva avuto due buone ragioni (Lucia had had two good reasons)."

        "content": "Italian inherits consecutio temporum, a grammar rule from Latin that governs the relationship between the tenses in principal and subordinate clauses. Consecutio temporum has very rigid rules. These rules require the subjunctive tense in order to express contemporaneity, posteriority and anteriority in relation with the principal clause.\n\nTo express contemporaneity when the principal clause is in a simple tense (future, present, or simple past), the subordinate clause uses the present subjunctive, to express contemporaneity in the present.\nPenso che Davide sia intelligente. I think David is smart.\nWhen the principal clause has a past imperfect or perfect, the subordinate clause uses the imperfect subjunctive, expressing contemporaneity in the past.\nPensavo che Davide fosse intelligente. I thought David was smart.\nTo express anteriority when the principal clause is in a simple tense (future, or present or passato prossimo) the subordinate clause uses the past subjunctive.\nPenso che Davide sia stato intelligente. I think David has been smart.\nTo express anteriority when the principal clause has a past imperfect or perfect, the subjunctive has to be pluperfect.\nPensavo che Davide fosse stato intelligente. I thought David had been smart.\nTo express posteriority the subordinate clause uses the future tense in the indicative mood, not the subjunctive, because the subjunctive has no future tense.\nPenso che Davide sarà intelligente. I think David will be smart.\nTo express posteriority with respect to a past event, the subordinate clause uses the past conditional, whereas in other European languages (such as French, English, and Spanish) the present conditional is used.\nPensavo che Davide sarebbe stato intelligente. I thought that David would have been smart."

This subgroup of third conjugation verbs is usually referred to as incoativi, because in Latin the original function of the suffix -sc- was to denote inchoative verbs, but this meaning is totally lost in modern Italian, where the suffix mostly serves a euphonic function."

All verbs add the same ending to this root.\nSome verbs do not follow this pattern, but take irregular roots, these include:\nAndare ('to go') ~ Andr-, Avere ('to have') ~ Avr-, Bere ('to drink') ~ Berr-,\nDare ('to give') ~ Dar-, Dovere ('to have to') ~ Dovr-, Essere ('to be') ~ Sar-,\nFare ('to make/do') ~ Far-, Godere ('to enjoy') ~ Godr-, Potere ('to be able to') ~ Potr-,\nRimanere ('to remain') ~ Rimarr-, Sapere ('to know') ~ Sapr-, Sedere ('to sit') ~ Sedr-,\nStare ('to be/feel') ~ Star-, Tenere ('to hold') ~ Terr-, Vedere ('to see') ~ Vedr-,\nVenire ('to come') ~ Verr-, Vivere ('to live') ~ Vivr-, Volere ('to want') ~ Vorr- etc.\nThe Italian conditional mood is a mood that refers to an action that is possible or probable, but is dependent upon a condition. Example:\n\n## Verbs > ### Regular conjugation > #### Conditional mood > ##### Table 31\n\n<pre>```\n| 0                                           | 1                                                |\n|:--------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|\n| Io andrei in spiaggia, ma fa troppo freddo. | (\"I would go to the beach, but it is too cold.\") |\n```</pre>\n\n\nIt can be used in two tenses, the present, by conjugation of the appropriate verb, or the past, using the auxiliary conjugated in the conditional, with the past participle of the appropriate noun:\n\n## Verbs > ### Regular conjugation > #### Conditional mood > ##### Table 32\n\n<pre>```\n| 0                                                                                 | 1                                                                       |\n|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mangerei un sacco adesso, se non stessi cercando di fare colpo su queste ragazze. | (\"I would eat a lot now, if I were not trying to impress these girls.\") |\n| Sarei andato in città, se avessi saputo che ci andavano loro.                     | (\"I would have gone to the city, if I had known that they were going.\") |\n```</pre>\n\n\nMany Italian speakers often use the imperfect instead of the conditional and subjunctive. Prescriptivists usually view this as incorrect, but it is frequent in colloquial speech and tolerated in all but high registers and in most writing:\n\n## Verbs > ### Regular conjugation > #### Conditional mood > ##### Table 33\n\n<pre>```\n| 0                                                                                    | 1                                                                                   |\n|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Se lo sapevo, andavo in spiaggia                                                     | (\"If I had known it, I would have gone to the beach.\")                              |\n| Se Lucia non faceva quel segno, la risposta sarebbe probabilmente stata diversa.[25] | (\"If Lucia had not made that sign, the answer would probably have been different.\") |\n```</pre>\n\n\nThe conditional can also be used in Italian to express \"could\", with the conjugated forms of potere ('to be able to'), \"should\", with the conjugated forms of dovere ('to have to'), or \"would like\", with the conjugated forms of volere ('want'):\n\n## Verbs > ### Regular conjugation > #### Conditional mood > ##### Table 34\n\n<pre>```\n| 0                                        | 1                                          |\n|:-----------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|\n| [Lui] potrebbe leggere un libro.         | (\"He could read a book.\")                  |\n| [Loro] dovrebbero andare a letto.        | (\"They should go to bed.\")                 |\n| Vorrei un bicchiere d'acqua, per favore. | (\"I would like a glass of water, please.\") |\n```</pre>"

        "content": "While the majority of Italian verbs are regular, many of the most commonly used are irregular. In particular, the auxiliary verbs essere, stare and avere, and the common modal verbs dovere (expressing necessity or obligation), potere (expressing permission and to a lesser degree ability), sapere (expressing ability) and volere (expressing willingness) are all irregular.\nThe only irregular verbs of the first conjugation are dare ('to give'), which follows the same pattern as stare, and andare ('to go'), which features suppletive forms in the present of the indicative, subjunctive and imperative from the Latin verb VADERE. While apparently a 1st conjugation verb, fare is actually a highly irregular verb of the second conjugation. Even the third conjugation features a small handful of irregular verbs, such as morire ('to die'), whose present is muoio, muori, muore, moriamo, morite, muoiono (indicative) and muoia, muoia, muoia, moriamo, moriate, muoiano (subjunctive).\nThe second conjugation combines the second and third conjugation of Latin; since the verbs belonging to the third conjugation were athematic, and they behaved less regularly than the ones belonging to the other conjugations (compare AMĀRE > AMAVI, AMATVS, first conjugation, and LEGĚRE > LEGI, LECTVS, third conjugation), the second conjugation Italian features many irregularities that trace back to the original paradigms of the Latin verbs: amare > amai, amato (first conjugation, regular), but leggere > lessi, letto (second conjugation, irregular).\n\n## Verbs > ### Irregular verbs > #### Table 36: essere(to be;
